## 1) Fix One Thing

If an overwhelming feeling of too much to do and too little time to accomplish anything has you feeling paralyzed, then you are likely to avoid practicing. To overcome the feeling and get practicing, pick one small, simple and achievable task.

When the task is small enough that you can focus on one single thing, then you can achieve it. Making small achievements will continue to motivate you to stick it out and help you make small accomplishments. Time does not go by wasted and over time your small accomplishments result in you reaching your bigger goals.

Do something small and create a flow. Getting started will get you motivated.

## 2) Play Something You Love, Listen to Inspiration

Play your favorite song. Regardless to how irrelevant your favorite song may seem to what you are practicing, hearing something you love is inspiring. Your creative senses will begin to stir.

## 3) Be Silly

Sometimes the thing holding you back is the association of playing your instrument with work. If the hardest part, what is keeping you from practicing, is just picking up your instrument, think of trying to tackle a new or weird sound effect. Do something fun and be silly. Exploring the sounds that your instrument is able to produce, will inspire you.

Always keep your instrument in sight. If it is tucked away, it may seem like too much work to dig it out. Leave it some where safe but easy to access.

## 4) Show Someone How to Play Something

It is common knowledge that learning new things is often motivating and inspirational for a student. However, sometimes we forget that teaching can be just as motivating and inspirational for the teacher as it is for the student. Share something you know, spread your passion and the result will be fueling your own fire.

## 5) Think of How You'll Feel Later if You Neglect Your Practice Now

If positive affirmations and inspiration do not put you in the right mind set to practice, try reminding yourself how you will feel forgoing your practice. This sort of reminder might be enough to remind you of how harmless spending a few minutes on your instrument is and how much better it will make you feel in the long run. Regret tends to last a lot longer than the few moments it will take you to practice. Associate your mindless distractions with the guilt of not practicing to get yourself into a more eager mindset to work. When you have made up 100 excuses not to practice, what you really need is to cut out that part of your brain, just think of the goal, the reward, the motivation.

## 6) Plan For Your Break

It may sound silly but planning for your break before you even start may be what you need to get started. If you plan to reward yourself with a cup of coffee, tea or juice after a half hour practice session, you will have something to look forward to that may keep you on track and something to motivate you to start your practice.

## 7) Set Yourself a time

Maybe a deadline will help you out. Set yourself a time to practice so that you can get it done and feel good about the time that you have until you do practice and the free time you will have after you finish practicing. It might be just what you need, some space before you begin practicing to start practicing. Sometimes that is the best thing you can do.

However, be warned, if it is late and you know you are unlikely to follow through with your plans, it would be better to do a little time now and perhaps more later than just throwing in the towel and doing none at all.

Create your own little practice space, one that you can make your own and keep all of the things you may need when you are practicing.  

## 8) Reward Yourself

Plan to reward yourself for your hard work. If you complete a set amount of time or a goal that you had set for yourself. Reward yourself with a treat. Whether it is the cup of coffee or juice (#6) or a couple bucks towards retail therapy, keep your treats rewarding and maintainable to ensure your consistent practice.

## 9) Inspiration

What inspired you to ever pic up your instrument in the first place. Look deep into yourself and if you have a strong passion for anything, you can share it with others. Don't take failure seriously, and instead look at it as a learning experience that you can rise above and don't take it personally

## 10) Fake It Till You Make It

Even if you don't feel like practicing, act like you do. Strangely enough, within a few moments, you'll feel motivated.
