Did you know that headphones were originally created to help listeners hear a quiet and concentrated piece of music. Interestingly enough, this differs largely from the original purpose that music has held within our societies and cultures. Largely an aspect of social gathering and bonding, through headphones, music has become an single, independent and intimate experience.

So what you might say? Could there really be a larger impact than more independent music listeners? Well, scientists are studying those very facts right now and they are coming across some interesting things. It is possible that headphones are actually creating bubbles around the wearers, disconnecting them from the social world they live in and transporting them to their own little world. The new way to say "I'm here, but I'm not present."

So, what is the impact of wearing headphones in the workplace. It is actually a heated mattter of debate with co-workers arguing for headphones and students wearing headphones in libraries, study halls and anywhere you can catch them with their nose in a book or eyes on a screen. But is it helping or hindering them? Well, there is actually scientific evidence that states that listening to music or other audio while working or studying negatively impacts concentration, productivity and memory recall. All of these studies tell us that we can be higher functioning and more productive individuals without our headphones so why then do we always tend to reach for them when it is time to bunker down and pump out some work? Largely, it is the fact that in a public space, which work and often the areas we study are, it creates a feeling of oasis. You can drone out the hustle and bustle of the rest of the world. Do it enough and it becomes habit. Suddenly being at home alone and throwing in headphones avoids the loneliness you might otherwise feel without your constant backing track reminder that you aren't alone.

So, maybe they help you get things done but maybe not. 

MAIN IDEA
Headphones create privacy in hearing music and is slightly changing the world. Music was a social bonding experience. Not anymore. How has using headphones changed our social and workplace behaviour?

Headphones in the workplace: studies - why we still use them.

Original purpose for headphones and today's intention

More solitude. Influences mood.
