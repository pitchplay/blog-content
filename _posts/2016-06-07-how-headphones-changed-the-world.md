Headphones were created to help listeners hear a quiet and concentrated piece of music. This differs from the role that music has held within our societies for centuries. To an individual, music was once an aspect of __social gathering__ and __bonding__. Through headphones, music is a __single__, independent and __intimate experience__.

## Here But Not Present

Headphones create [bubbles](http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2007-01-23/bubbles-sound-public-space/) around the wearers. Disconnected from the social world they live in, they are transported to their own inclusive space. To everyone around us, wearing headphones has become the new way to say:

#### *I'm here, but I'm not present.*

## Achieving Sanctuary

This headphone isolation effect seems like a step backwards. Our abilities to connect with one another is hampered by wearing headphones. However, the head gear has a few proven benefits.

[Studies](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/LESIUKarticle2005.pdf?version=meter+at+1&module=meter-Links&pgtype=article&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.ca%2F&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click) suggest that listening to music at work can result in positive mood changes and increased quality of work. Perhaps you already know this and it is why you find yourself reaching for your headphones on a stressful day.

With headphones, you can set the expectation that you are in the work-zone. You will be less likely to be distracted by others or allow others to distract you.

## The Distraction

Although you may only think of the feel goods when you reach for your music, headphones can have negative impacts on your productivity.

Unfortunately, [studies](https://hbr.org/2012/04/workers-take-off-your-headphon) also show adverse effects to using headphones in the workplace. These studies suggest that audio stimulation, including music, has been proven to result in decreased concentration, productivity and memory recall.

For some, headphones can be a blessing. When work is monotonous or has fast-paced deadlines, music can be motivation. For others, it can be a distraction.
