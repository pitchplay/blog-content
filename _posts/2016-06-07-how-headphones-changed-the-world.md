Did you know that headphones were originally created to help listeners hear a quiet and concentrated piece of music. Interestingly enough, this differs largely from the purpose that music has held within our societies for centuries. Largely an aspect of social gathering and bonding, through headphones, music has become a single, independent and intimate experience. Headphones are changing music's role and function within our societies around the world.

## Here But Not Present

Headphones, scientists claim, are creating bubbles around the wearers, disconnecting them from the social world they live in and transporting them to their own little world. To everyone around us, wearing headphones has become the new way to say,

#### *I'm here, but I'm not present.*

## Achieving Sanctuary

[Studies](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/LESIUKarticle2005.pdf?version=meter+at+1&module=meter-Links&pgtype=article&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.ca%2F&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click) suggest that listening to music while at work can be responsible for positive mood changes and increased quality of work. Perhaps you already know this and it is the very reason why you find yourself reaching for headphones during a stressful work or study day.

When your co-worker is discussing his weekend plans and you are focusing on the task at hand but you can't help in being drawn towards his interesting social life, you reign in your focus by creating your bubble. Headphones allow you to set the expectation that you are in a work-zone, you are less likely to be distracted by others. Yet, there are many arguments against listening to music while at work. Does music positively or negatively impact your productivity and concentration?

## Myth or Fact

Music can have both negative and positive impacts on an individual's productivity.

Music is beneficial for motivating and maintaining a good mood, particularly when the task at hand is repetitive or mindless. It, your soundtrack, and musical retreat will keep you moving forward on days where the work seems redundant and the minutes move slow.

But, music can just as easily be a distraction. In general, we are more productive and higher functioning individuals without music or audio stimulation while working or studying. Listening to music decreases concentration, productivity and memory recall.

In a work environment where the workplace is designed for open floors where discussion can be freely conducted, the creative or deep thinker becomes impaired by such distractions. In these times, creating your own bubble can be helpful. Headphones can help you do this.

You miss out on hearing conversations, ideas, collective knowledge basis, erode employee cohesiveness.

Should be encouraged to work alone when creativity or high productivity is at the forefront. Instant messaging is also not the worst thing but you need protocols that avoid isolation. Too much personal bubbles create a lonely crowd. We need to be open to and understand great work environments with multi-lunches, sports, lots of communication, walk around, etc.

Do you fell more productive with headphones in?
