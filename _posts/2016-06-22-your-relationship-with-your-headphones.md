Headphones were created to help listeners hear a quiet and concentrated piece of music. This differs from the role that music has held within our societies for centuries. To the individual, pre-headphone era music was an aspect of social gathering and bonding. This differs from how music is experienced through headphones. Now in the midst of the headphone era, music is often an independent and intimate experience.

## Here But Not Present

Headphones create [bubbles](http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2007-01-23/bubbles-sound-public-space/) around the wearers. These "bubbles" transport wearers to their own inclusive space. Headphones have become the way to say:

#### *I'm here, but I'm not present.*

## Achieving Sanctuary

This headphone isolation may seem like a social step backwards. However, the ability to isolate ourselves from the very loud and fast-paced world around us may be the very thing needed to increase our productivity and concentration in the workplace. If the conditions are right, with music in your headphones and engaging work to be completed, your consciousness enters a state called [flow](http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/how-to-achieve-the-creative-state-of-flow/). Completing tasks becomes enjoyable and satisfying in a state of "flow."

[Studies](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/business/LESIUKarticle2005.pdf?version=meter+at+1&module=meter-Links&pgtype=article&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.ca%2F&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click) suggest that listening to music at work can result in positive mood changes and an increased quality of work. Perhaps you already know this and it is why you find yourself reaching for your headphones on a stressful day.

With headphones, you can set the expectation that you are in the work-zone. You will be less likely to be distracted by others or allow others to distract you. Today's open offices are known for facilitating noise. Consider how often you think of the click-clacking keyboards around you. Do you ever involve yourself in discussions of a co-worker's weekend plans?

Deciding which is the greater distraction, music or the noisy surrounding office space, may not be a difficult one to make.

## The "Distraction" Argument

Although you may only think of the *feel goods* when you reach for your music, many employers argue against the use of headphones in the workplace. Often considered amongst the adverse effects of wearing headphones are: decreased productivity, concentration and memory recall.

However, studies that pit headphones and productivity against one another often make little to no distinction between the distracting qualities of music versus the distracting qualities of general audio stimulation.  

This is an important distinction to make because the office noise around you is typically more distracting than your music. This rings particularly true when stress associated with office noises can lead to increased levels of [cortisol](https://rise.xyz/blog/music-at-work-productivity/) in the body. When cortisol hormone levels rise, the brainâ€™s high functioning planning and reasoning is effected. Your ability to carry out the tasks at hand becomes compromised.

If you find your stress levels spike due to surrounding office noises, consider balancing your brain with some [dopamine](http://blog.pitchplay.io/music/music-the-feel-good-drug). In other words, it may be time to talk to your employer about the benefits of getting out your headphones.
