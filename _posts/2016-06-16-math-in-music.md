Despite their often distinct separation from one another in classrooms, music and math have a close relationship that has been intertwined for centuries. Regardless of your mathematical capabilities, understanding what ties the relationship between music and math together is both interesting and helpful in becoming a better musician.

## The Equation

When you look at a piece of music, the symbols on the page tell the musician many things about it. These symbols, once understood, are like the parts of an equation. They help you play the music like you would be able to solve an equation when the symbols are understood.

## Parts of an Equation

A piece of music is composed of multiple bars and each bar has multiple beats. Rhythm is determined by understanding the relationship of beats to one another within any given bar.

The different shapes of notes found within a piece of music represent different numerical values. The shape of a note lets us know how long the note is sounded for. For example, the __whole note__ has a durational value of 4. Can you guess the value of the __half note__?

*The relationship between notes within a given bar is one of relativity.*

The __quarter note__ is 1/4 of the whole note and 1/2 the value of the half note. If you have two half notes followed by 2 quarter notes, you know that those quarter notes will be double the speed of the half notes.

### It's All Relative

Rhythmic context can differ from piece to piece. On YouTube you can listen to 5 different covers of the same song and each song could be a different length. Although the 5 songs are all recognizable and relatable to the original,the speed that each musician performs the song at is different thus changing the rhythmic context.

### Time Signature

The time signature is generally composed of two numbers, often thought of as a fraction. However, the numbers are not actually a fraction in musical contexts. Yet, when you are determining which note is worth a beat, looking at the time signature as a fraction is helpful. For example, if the bottom number is a 4, pretend the top number is a 1 (despite whatever it is). This gives you 1/4 (one-quarter) which tells you that the quarter note gets the beat. If the bottom number is an 8, 1/8 (one-eighth) you know that the eighth note gets the beat.

## Pitches on the Page

Like the rhythmic components of a piece of music, the pitches are also mathematically related to one another. An interval is the term used to describe the melodic distance from one note to the next. For example, the interval of an octave means that two notes will be 8 steps apart from one another on a staff.

Also mathematically related to music is the wavelength and frequencies of notes. In other words, how notes sound and the differences between different pitches. Every note has a particular wavelength. The frequency of a note is calculated by the number of waves that occur per unit of time when a note sounds. In the interval of an octave, the top note's wavelength is double the frequency of the bottom note's. Therefore, we know that the bottom note has a lower frequency (half the frequency to be exact), we know it will sound lower.

The closest tie between music and math is __patterns__.  You can find patterns in rhythms, melodies and structures of songs.

Like in mathematics, patterns in music explain and predict the unknown. We can predict how a song will sound without playing it and make assumptions as to what will come next by being aware of the patterns and relationships within music.
