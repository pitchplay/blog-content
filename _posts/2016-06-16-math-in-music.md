Despite their often distinct separation from one another in classrooms, math and music have a close relationship. In fact, the relationship between math and music has been intertwined for centuries.  Understanding this relationship and what ties the relationship together is both interesting and helpful in becoming a better musician despite your mathematical capabilities.

## The Equation

When you look at a piece of music, the symbols on the page tell the musician many things about the music. These symbols, like the parts of an equation, enable you to play the music once understood. Similarly, it is easy to solve an equation once you understand the parts of the equation.

## Parts of an Equation

A piece of music is composed of multiple bars and each bar has multiple beats. A piece of music's rhythm is determined by understanding the relationship of beats to one another within any given bar.

The different shapes of notes found within a piece of music represent different numerical values. The shape of a note lets us know how long the note is sounded for. For example, the __whole note__ has a durational value of 4. Can you guess the value of the __half note__?

#### *The relationship between notes within a given bar is one of relativity.*

The __quarter note__ is 1/4 of the whole note, or 1/2 the value of the half note. Therefore, if you have two half notes followed by 2 quarters, you know that those quarter notes will be double the speed of the half notes.

### It's All Relative

Rhythmic context can differ from piece to piece. On YouTube you can listen to 5 different covers of the same song and each song would be a different length. Although the 5 songs are all recognizable and relatable to the original, the rhythmic context has changed because the speed that each musician performs the song at is different. The overall speed of a piece of music is referred to as __tempo__. Determining the tempo and how a tempo effects a piece of music can be understood from both the *tempo cue* and *time signature*.

### Tempo Cue

The tempo cue is listed at the beginning of most pieces. It may be written as a word that's representative of a [metronome marking](http://www.classicalmusiccity.com/search/article.php?vars=446/Basic-Tempo-Markings.html) like: *Adagio* or *Larghetto*. Or, sometimes instead of the word, or you may see *a note = a number*. For example, <quarter note = 112 image>.


### Time Signature

The time signature, found at the beginning of a bar, is generally composed of two numbers, often thought of as a fraction. Despite the fact that the numbers are not actually a fraction in musical contexts. Yet, when you are determining which note is worth a beat, looking at the time signature as a fraction is helpful. For example, if the bottom number is a 4, pretend the top number is a 1 (despite whatever it is). This gives you 1/4 (one-quarter) which tells you that the quarter note gets the beat. If the bottom number is an 8, 1/8 (one-eighth) you know that the eighth note gets the beat.

## Did You Know?

The Fibonacci sequence can be found in piano scales. The sequence that follows as: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, â€¦ and so on, adding each term to the one before it to create the next term.  That is, 5 + 8 = 13, 8 + 13 = 21, 13 + 21 = 34, and continuing infinitely.  Can you spot it?


The C scale on the piano consists of 13 keys from C to C; eight white keys and five black keys, with black keys arranged in groups of three and two.

### More Patterns

After having discovered that strings that are halved in length are one octave higher than the original, Pythagoras noticed that the notes of certain frequencies sound better with multiple frequencies of that note.  For example, a note of 220Hz sounds best with notes of 440Hz, 660Hz, and so on.

The closest tie between music and math is __patterns__.  You can find patterns in how music's relativity relationships, in the notes of a scale or the different frequencies found on a string. Furthermore, there are patterns in repeating choruses or bars in your favorite song.

In mathematics, patterns explain and predict the unknown and its in the music that we love that we discover the same patterns that predict and make a song feel familiar.  

The relationship between math and music is one that barely scratches the surface here. What do you think, do math and music relate?
