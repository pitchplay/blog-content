Title - name the exercise making it as specific
or non-specific as you want.
  - "C major scale in whole notes" OR "major scale"

#### Step 2:
Type - determine what type of exercise you will be working on.
We have listed seven exercise types for you to choose from. If you are unsure of what type the exercise you are practicing is, you can read the list below for help.![](/assets/img/2016-04-18/image3.png)

#### Step 5:
Notes - if you have any additional information that you would like to note about your practice such as small goals, BPM, or specific metres to work on, note it here.

### Practice Canvas

On the left hand side of your practice canvas (once you've clicked __Go Practice__ on the Dashboard) is the
collapsible tracking of the exercises that you
are aiming to complete during your practice session.

By clicking __Start__, you will be beginning the practice session. If at any point you need
to pause, click __Stop__.
