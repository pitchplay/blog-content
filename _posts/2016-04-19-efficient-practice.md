How do you get better at practicing? You can begin by analyzing the ways
in which you have been practicing inefficiently. So, before we discover how to
make the most of your practice sessions, it is helpful to recognize some common
practice habits:

## The Broken Record Method
Do you find yourself repeating the same thing over and over? It may seem like
practice but it is often mindless repetition. <image/gif of record on a record player>

## The Autopilot Method
Do you activate your autopilot system and coast through your practices? This can happen
 when running through a piece or a set of tunes from beginning to end. Sometimes,
you can't even recall playing through sections of particular pieces. <image of airplane pilot>

## The Hybrid Method
Perhaps you have taken on a hybrid of the two methods. This could result in mindlessly playing through a piece until
a mistake is found. The mistake might bump you out of autopilot and throw you into a broken
record method. You might find yourself drilling a passage until it begins to sound better. Then, you will likely resume autopilot.

## So What's The Problem Anyways?
The biggest problem is that your brain is not remaining engaged while you are
practicing. If you practice mindlessly, you are wasting valuable time.
 When you are mentally engaged during your practice, you will be more productive.
Becoming engaged is accomplished by setting goals and knowing how to work
towards achieving them. You must be monitoring your practice and critically
looking for ways to improve your playing.

## Ignite the Ambition

I had an adult student who began his lessons with me excited about learning the
violin. He had spent some time learning from video tutorials online but he wanted to know more.
At first, I could tell that between lessons, he had worked on some of the technical stuff we had talked
about. For a little while, he got better. Then, he lost his habit of
practicing. Despite wanting to get better, he was having a difficult time getting back on track.
One week, I encouraged him to pick up his violin every day and do something that he enjoyed. I told him not to bother with a tune or technique. Just play the instrument.
The next week I asked him to do the same thing every day but this time work on 1 bar of a tune each day. By the following week he had learned and memorized a 30 measure piece.

I had made the mistake of not helping direct him with small, __focused goals__. I was overwhelming him
with information and he did not know where to begin when he picked up his violin. So, he had stopped picking up his violin altogether.
First, remember why you enjoy picking up your instrument. Then, set yourself some small, manageable goals.

## A Tool you can Use

There are a few tools that you can use to help you keep track of your
goals. _PitchPlay_ helps with both planning and tracking your practice sessions. You can
break up every thing you want to work on into individual exercises and divide your time
appropriately.

## Mistakes are Expensive

Mistakes not only cost your time to repair but they risk your confidence in your abilities.
Practicing should build you security in your performances. If you are making mistakes when you are
practicing, it means
that you are going too fast to learn the music or that your brain is tired. So, you need to
slow down or take a break. Once you understand why it is that you are able to play something right or wrong, you
have understood the technical or mechanical factors that are necessary to play something
correctly. It is no longer a coincidence to get something right.

## Efficient Practice

So, where will you be in two months if you can keep your brain actively engaged during practice sessions?
What level will you achieve if you can maintain consistent practice and
set small, manageable goals? When will you get there if you employ a few tools to help you track
and plan your practice and avoid allowing yourself to fall into any bad habits?

You'll be a lot further ahead than you are now!
