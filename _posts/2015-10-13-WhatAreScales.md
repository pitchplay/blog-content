A scale is simply a collection of notes that has a predefined order or pattern it follows. The most well known scale in Western music is the `C Major` scale. All `major scales` follow the same pattern of `whole-tones` and `half-tones` (otherwise known as a `semitone`).

Major scales follow this pattern:
`W - W - H - W - W - W - H`

Something to remember: the first note in a scale is called the `root` note or the `tonic` (from the word `tone`, not the popular additive to gin cocktails.)

Let's break one down in text before we look at it on the stave. We'll make a little scale formula table:

| Note Name | + W or H      | = Next Note |
|---        |---            |---          |
| C         | W             | D           |
| D         | W             | E           |
| E         | H             | F           |
| F         | W             | G           |
| G         | W             | A           |
| A         | W             | B           |
| B         | H             | C           |

Let's take a quick look at what is happening in that table. The starting note `C` is the root note or tonic. When we add a `whole-tone` to it we get `D` (a `half-tone` or `semitone` would give us `C#`). Next, we start on `D` and using our scale formula we know that we are to add another `whole-tone` since this is a `major scale`. `D` plus another `whole-tone` gives us `E`. Now, we move on to the first `half-tone` or `semitone` in the formula: `E` plus a `half-tone` gives us `F`. Follow the table back down the list and see how each note yields the following note in the scale simply by using this formula.

If you line up the letters in the left-most column of this table, you'll see that we have the `C Major` scale:   
`C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C`

So, why are most musicians taught `C Major` as their first scale? It's simple - there are no sharps or flats in this scale. In fact, it's the only major scale without any accidentals (which is the name for things like sharps, flats, and certain other notative symbols on a stave). Therefore, on a piano, `C Major` is played exclusively on the white keys making it an easy scale to learn. The rest of us who aren't pianists usually just follow the same basic structure when first learning. Awesome trivia time -- traditionally, the `C Major` scale is the base scale for *solfege*: the `Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do` tune many of us learn as kids.

Want to do see another major scale example? Check out Ab major:

| Note Name  | + W or H      | = Next Note  |
|---         |---            |---           |
| Ab         | W             | Bb           |
| Bb         | W             | C            |
| C          | H             | Db           |
| Db         | W             | Eb           |
| Eb         | W             | F            |
| F          | W             | G            |
| G          | H             | Ab           |

Whoa! There we go, now we've got something that looks complex. But it's not - this follows the exact same pattern as the above `C Major` example. Let's break it down:
`Ab` is our `root` note or `tonic`. `Ab` to `Bb` is a `whole-tone`. `Bb` to `C` is a `whole-tone`. Then we hit our first `half-tone` increment which is: `C` to `Db`. If you follow from here on your own, it will work out - trust me! Again, we can take all of the letters in the left-most column and use them to create the `Ab Major` scale:   
`Ab - Bb - C - Db - Eb - F - G - Ab`

`Minor` scales have a different formula:
`W - H - W - W - H - W - W`

We'll do one example of a minor scale then call it day on this post. Let's try `C minor`.

| Note Name | + W or H      | = Next Note |
|---        |---            |---          |
| C         | W             | D           |
| D         | H             | Eb          |
| Eb        | W             | F           |
| F         | W             | G           |
| G         | H             | Ab          |
| Ab        | W             | Bb          |
| Bb        | W             | C           |

The resulting scale? `C - D - Eb - F - G - Ab - Bb - C`.

There are **many** more scales and scale patterns out there, but they are certainly deserving of a separate post. For now, just remember: a scale is nothing but a grouping of notes that adheres to a pattern. If you can remember the pattern, then you can figure out any scale simply by starting with the `tonic` and going from there!
