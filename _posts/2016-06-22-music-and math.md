Music and math are often separated subjects in the classroom. Despite this separation, the two have had an intertwined relationship for centuries. Understanding what ties the two together will make you a better musician.

## The Equation

When you look at a piece of music, the symbols on the page tell the musician many things about it. These symbols, once understood, are like the parts of an equation. They help you play the music like you would be able to solve an equation.

## Parts of the Equation

A piece of music is composed of many bars and each bar has multiple beats. The combination of bars and beats makes up what we know as the rhythm.

The different shapes of notes represent different numerical values.

*The relationship between notes within a given bar is one of relativity.*

The __quarter note__ is 1/4 of the value of the whole note and 1/2 the value of the half note. All note values are related to one another within a piece of music.

### It's All Relative

Rhythmic context can differ from piece to piece. On YouTube you can listen to five different covers of the same song and each song could be a different length. Although they would all be relatable to the original, the speed of each song would be different. So, the rhythmic context of each performance is different.

## Time Signature

The time signature is composed of two numbers and is often thought of as a fraction. Despite not actually being a fraction, when determining the rhythm from a written piece of music, looking at the time signature as a fraction is helpful.

For example, if the bottom number is a 4, pretend the top number is a 1 (despite whatever it is). This gives you 1/4 (one-quarter) which tells you that the quarter note __gets the beat__. If the bottom number is an 8, 1/8 (one-eighth) you know that the eighth note gets the beat.

The top number tells you __how many beats__ occur within each bar. If it is a 3, there will be 3 beats in the bar.

## Pitches on the Page

Like the rhythmic components of a piece of music, the melodic components are also mathematically related to one another. An interval is the term used to describe the melodic distance from one note to the next. For example, the interval of an __octave__ means that two notes will be __8__ steps apart from one another on a staff.

Also mathematically related to music are the [wavelengths and frequencies](https://www.boundless.com/users/232513/textbooks/understanding-basic-music-theory/the-physical-basis-3/acoustics-for-music-theory-18/wavelength-frequency-and-pitch-89-13565/) of notes. In other words, how notes sound and the distinctions between pitches. Every note has a particular wavelength. The frequency of a note is calculated by the number of waves that occur per unit of time when a note sounds.

In the interval of an octave, the top note's wavelength is double the frequency of the bottom note's. Therefore, we know that the bottom note has a lower frequency (half the frequency to be exact). We know it will sound lower.

## Patterns

Patterns tie music and math together.  You can find mathematical patterns within rhythms, melodies and the structures of  songs.

Just as they do in mathematics, patterns in music explain and predict the unknown. Through the observation of the patterns within, we can predict how a song will sound without even playing it. We can also predict what will come next by being aware of the patterns and relationships found from one song to another.
