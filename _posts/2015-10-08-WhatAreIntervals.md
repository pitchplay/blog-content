At its most basic definition, an interval is simply the distance between two notes.

In music, we name these distances because intervals mean a lot to us and names help give things context. Let's start with an example.

The C-Major scale, which is one of the first things musicians are often taught, goes: `C D E F G A B C`. It's an easy beginner scale because it doesn't incorporate any sharps or flats and, on the piano, is played all on the white keys. Many people also learn as children of *solfege*: `Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do`.

OK - I haven't actually talked about intervals yet. The most basic interval (and the interval that must exist in any equation) is the `root note`. The root note is the note that the scale or interval is based on -- in our above example, it's the first `C`. Technically speaking, the root note isn't an interval, but rather is the anchor for other intervals. Even more technically, the root note to the root note (in other words, the same note twice) is referred to as a `unison` interval.

In the table below, I'll list each note in the C major scale and the named interval it represents in that scale.

| Note #      | Note Name | Interval Name             |
|---          |---        |-------------------------  |
|1            | C         | root / unison             |
|2            | D         | major second              |
|3            | E         | major third               |
|4            | F         | perfect fourth            |
|5            | G         | perfect fifth             |
|6            | A         | major sixth               |
|7            | B         | major seventh             |
|8            | C         | octave / perfect eighth   |  

As you can see, each interval name aligns with its position in the scale relative to the root (1) note. A `perfect fourth` is the fourth interval in the scale (again, including the root as one).

Those are the notes that make up the `C-Major` scale, but of course they aren't "all" of the notes on a typical Western instrument. Here is a list (from `C` to `C`) of all intervals:

|Note # | Note Name | Interval Name             |
|---    |---        |-------------------------  |
| 1     | C         | root / unison             |
| 2     | Db        | minor second              |
| 3     | D         | major second              |
| 4     | Eb        | minor third               |
| 5     | E         | major third               |
| 6     | F         | perfect fourth            |
| 7     | Gb        | tritone / diminished fifth |
| 8     | G         | perfect fifth             |
| 9     | Ab        | minor sixth               |
| 10    | A         | major sixth               |
| 11    | Bb        | minor seventh             |
| 12    | B         | major seventh             |
| 13    | C         | octave / perfect eighth   |

You may be asking, "Hey Rob, why did you list the notes as flats instead of sharps"? In other words, why have I listed Db as the minor second instead of C# since they are the "same note"? See [enharmonic equivalents] for a background, but otherwise know this - `C#`/`Db` are the same pitch, but are referred to differently depending on the context. Clear as mud? Click the enharmonic link.

Here is the easiest way to explain (and show) why we used `Db` in this case: The distance from C to D on a stave is one space. Therefore the distance between C and Db is also one space (though the note on the D line is flatted, obviously). If we used C# instead then both notes would be on the C line and would not make sense spatially. So even though they sound the same, it is not "technically" correct. See the example below:

If you're a guitarist, pianist, or just curious, then you may want to read our article [What Are Chords?] because chords are defined and built using intervals! As an example, the popular three-note `major chord` is made up of the `root`, `major third`, and `perfect fifth` intervals!
