Stuck in a rut? Do you want to make music learning fun again?

Music is emotional - it is fun and exciting. Sometimes changes in our lives
change how we perceive our musical experiences. This can be especially prevalent
in the music that we listen to, let alone what we play on our instruments.
Perhaps after going through a break-up, something about Sam Hunt’s “Take Your
Time” really hits home. Or suddenly Eric Paslay and Little Big Town become
favorites that you may not have known existed before. Often when something in
your life changes, the way you perceive the lyrics and sounds of a genre
changes. Perhaps this leads you to find a new love for a new genre. It could
also reignite your excitement with an old genre or artist you listened to in the
past. Maybe you end up exploring something completely new to you! We have to
remind ourselves that our taste in music changes at different points in our
lives and, along with it, our interest, excitement, and emotional attachment
to playing certain pieces might as well. It is important to consider whether
your interest in listening to a particular artist or genre has changed. If it
has, do you need to modify what you are playing to maintain your interest in
practicing your instrument?

Sometimes because of a loss of interest or desire the time and availability you
once set aside for practicing disappears. Maybe life has become busier or
practicing just stopped seeming as important as it once was. When these things
happen, it is important to find a reason to practice or learn something new. I
try to ensure that my students and I are always working towards a performance.
I like to have quarterly recitals or get them playing in seniors' homes monthly.
For myself, I like to learn a new piece or revamp an old one for each
performance. If you think that you need to find a reason to practice or learn
new material, you can schedule yourself a performance or even a jam session with
friends. Make the performance or jam part of your routine to keep yourself
practicing on a consistent basis.

While I encourage working towards performances with my students I also try to
ensure that they have the opportunity to define what they want to learn and then
learn some of the things that they discover they like. I encourage them to
explore and to try composing their own pieces. Sometimes falling into a rut
happens because we feel like the music we play is too rehearsed. Sometimes we
realize the challenge and "unknown" that was originally there when we began
learning is gone. If music is not exciting for you anymore then we must find a
way to make it exciting. Try writing a harmony to a piece, learning more about
music theory or music history, expanding your musical knowledge and capability,
or even taking up a new instrument!

The bottom line is: when things seem to be getting mundane we must remember what
inspired us in the first place and try to recapture that musical magic in new
and exciting ways.
