<p>Stuck in a rut? Do you want to make music learning fun again?</p>

<p>Music is emotional - it is fun and exciting. And so is playing an instrument! But let's face it, listening and playing are two completely different beasts. One is passive, the other is active, and it's not terribly difficult to fall out of habit when something requires work on our part (just ask my gym membership). The worst part is, it's not just scales and exercises that can become stale - it's the music we play as well.</p> 
<p>Ask any touring musician how much they love playing their own songs when they're relaxing with their instrument. When you've played something to death then it's no longer new - and when it's no longer new it can be difficult to muster excitement.</p>
<p>So, let's examine some ways that we can make music fun again:</p>
<strong>1. Change it Up</strong>
<p>The biggest thing you can do to shake up your musical world is to pick some new compositions to learn. If you've recently experience an emotional change in your life, whether it be in your career, relationships, or any other positive or negative shift, you may find that the same tunes just aren't doing it for you. That's <strong>completely normal.</strong> If you're a blues or rock musician, give jazz or classical music a shot. You never know what beautiful melodies you may hear that you mightn't have been listening for before (consciously or otherwise). If orchestral and symphonic sounds are usually more your cup of tea, ask around for some heavy metal recommendations. Many rock and metal musicians are extremely talented and music savvy people who employ various modes and melodies in unique and beautiful ways.</p>
<strong>2. Record Yourself </strong>
<p>Have you been picking up your instrument and running the same patterns over and over? Perhaps it's time to break out of that mould by adding a new layer of creativity! PC and tablet based home-recording has seen exponential growth in the last decade and for good reason: things are getting <i>so affordable</i>. Consider grabbing a USB interface that will allow you to plug directly in to your computer (or set a microphone up to record your instrument or voice). Then, playback what you've done and improvise a harmony line over it. You can practice soloing or write accompaniments for your own compositions. All of a sudden that boring lick you'd been noodling with on the couch for 3 months has turned into a completely different sonic experience.</p>
<strong>3. Set Goals</strong>
<p>It should come as no surprise that one of the most common reasons we become bored with our instruments is because the challenge lessens the more we play. In fact, it was a driving factor when we created PitchPlay - how could we make the process of working with and playing music fun and challenging again? With that in mind, set some new goals for yourself:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Play scales at a fixed BPM (beats per minute) on your metronome. Too easy? <strong>Go faster.</strong></li>
    <li>Compose a song. Been there done that? <strong>Try writing one per day for a month.</strong></li>
    <li>Take up a new instrument.</li>
  </ul>
<p>That last one might not have been something you'd considered seriously - or perhaps it is, but you haven't pulled the trigger. Get out there, rent/borrow/buy a different instrument, and set to work figuring out how to become a stronger multi-instrumentalist.</p>
<p>There is no magic bullet solution for solving your musical woes - ruts happen. But hopefully this post has given you some new ideas or a fresh mindset with which to approach your instrument. After all, we play music to enjoy it. That passion is likely still there, you just may need some help rediscovering it.</p>
