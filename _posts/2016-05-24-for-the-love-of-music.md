Why do we love music and why does it make us feel so good? Feeling like music is one of those necessary ingredients to live life is not uncommon. In fact, determining why it is that humans spend so much time and energy on music has become a popular field of study by neuroscientists and psychologists. However, despite world-wide recognition of music as important to all individuals, the reason why humans invest so much time and energy into music is largely still a mystery. In their research, many scientists have determined that three main factors contribute to our love and enjoyment of music: intellectual, emotional and social.

## Music is an Intellectual Reward

Music is an exercise for your whole brain. Within moments of hearing music, your brain works to associate it with music you've heard in the past. Musical templates stored in your brain hold information regarding the way a particular piece of music was previously processed. Analysis of the music, including recognizable patterns and themes, are stored along with your emotional response to the music. Therefore, when you hear a brand new song, your brain searches through past templates to find similarities. This contributes to your ability to not only predict patterns in a new song but also largely determines your emotional response to the unfamiliar song.

## Neurochemical bliss

Upon hearing a new song, if your brain relates the tune to a template it has stored from music of your past, you'll find you also enjoy this new song. If you have not enjoyed it or it is unfamiliar to you, you may feel bored or disappointed and have difficulty relating to the unfamiliarity of the song.

Why do I have a favorite song?

The brain's pleasure circuit is stimulated which results in an influx of feel good neurochemicals. The more we like a song, the more we get treated to the neurochemical bliss. Scientifically speaking, the same euphoric reward responses we receive from sex and good food, we also experience with the music we love. Dopamine, is released in the brain which can cause a state of euphoria. Dopamine is the chemical released in our brain that is responsible for making us feel good. Causes a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction. Music has the ability to create a state of arousal and even though it doesn't have a direct survival benefit, it chemically alters our body and makes us feel great. It becomes addictive and causes us to seek out more. A perfectly natural drug of happiness.

## Social

Psychologists and neuroscientists have discovered that the songs that we loved in our teenage years hold disproportionate  power over our emotions. Our brains bind us to the music that we heard as teenagers more tightly than to anything that we hear as adults. Why does the music of our teenage years seem to stick with us so much? Some scientists believe it has to do with the music from those years being so fundamentally intertwined with our social lives. You discover who you are for the first time when you are young and it often happens through your friends. So listening to the same or similar music to your friends is like your representation of belonging to that social group. Music then melds into our sense of identity.

Regardless of whether your passion resides in listening to music, playing music or you dabble in a little of both, you are sure to have recognized what feels at times like an innate love for music. Despite our inability to pinpoint why music is a world-wide love affair, our appreciation, love and enjoyment from it has resulted in its ever prevalence within our societies and has even contributed to the rise of music therapy and recognition of the power of music as a tool for helping to combat pain and depression.

I'd love to hear about any intellectual, emotional or social effects that you've recognized music having over you. Start a conversation!
