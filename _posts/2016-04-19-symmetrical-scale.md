## 1. What Is It?
A symmetrical scale is any scale that equally divides the octave. The octave can be divided
into 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 parts.

The 6 tone symmetrical scale is a 6 note division of the octave. It is particularly unique because
of its simplistic scale pattern. Each note of the 6 tone symmetrical scale has a whole tone
in-between. With all the tones equal distance apart from one another, there is no strong feeling of tonality.
There is no one note that the other notes within the scale are centered around. The scale is known for its blurred, indistinct overall sound often described as having a “dreamy” quality.

The 6 tone symmetrical scale is also known as the __whole tone scale__ or the __hexatonic scale__.

## 2. Why You Need to Know This Scale
Each time you learn a different scale you are training
your muscles to automatically respond to particular sounds or patterns. Learning any scale
is important. In particular, this symmetrical scale has a simple pattern that is easy to remember.
This makes it accessible to play and imagine with or without your instrument in front of you. Go ahead, try to visualize it!


## 3. The Pattern
The 6 tone symmetrical scale is a series of __major 2nds__ (whole tones).
The pattern is simply: WT-WT-WT-WT-WT-WT. No matter which note you begin on, the pattern will always remain the same. Another way you can think of it is that there will be a half tone in-between each note of the scale. For example, if you started on an E, your next note will be an F# (the F is the half tone in-between the E and F#). The scale continues to move from F# to G# (the G is the half tone in-between). Can you continue the pattern?

> E - F# - G# - A# - C - D


## 4. Pick-up and Play
Start on any note and play whole tones between the pitches.  Count 6 notes
or be aware of playing within one octave.
For example, start with the C whole tone scale: C - D - E - F# - G# - A# - (C). You can add the top C if you would like although it is not necessary. There are no set rules. Additionally, if you wish to play the scale in several octaves, you could do that as well. Try playing the scale backwards. Once you become familiar with the pitches, try playing them in a different order. What does it sound like? Can you evoke the dreamy and blurred tonal quality that the scale is known for having?

## 5. Play One, Play Them All (well, sort of!)
Now try the 6 tone symmetrical scale starting on a different note. For example, D-E-F#-G#-A#-C. Did you notice that the whole tone scale starting on D has all of the same pitches as the C whole tone scale? The difference is that the notes fall in a different order.

>  C-D-E-F#-G#-A#

>  D-E-F#-G#-A#-C

In fact, there are only __two distinct__ whole tone (6 tone symmetrical) scales. Each consists of the alternate sets of 6 notes.

*Confused? Keep in mind that the C# whole tone scale is the same as the Db whole tone scale. The two scales have different spellings of the same notes.*


## 6. Starting Anywhere
You should know what the scale is and why you should play it. If you have not tried playing it, you should try to visualize yourself playing it on your instrument.
Pick a note or pick a string and play some 6 tone symmetrical scales. Make it part of your routine with [PitchPlay](http://pitchplay.io/).
