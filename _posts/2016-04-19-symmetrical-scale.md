Exotic scales open up new tonalities and patterns that can be explored on your instrument. The 6 tone symmetrical scale is an exotic scale with a particularly simple pattern that is easy to remember. This makes it very accessible to play.

Have you ever been in a situation where you felt overwhelmed by a key, progression of chords or what other instrumentalists were doing? Being unfamiliar with your instrument can cause a type of musical paralysis that is preventable. The more familiar you can make yourself with different scales and scale patterns, the more familiar you will become with your instrument. You will decrease your chances of coming across something unfamiliar or musically intimidating.

## Something Symmetrical
A symmetrical scale is any scale that equally divides the octave. The octave can be divided
into 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 parts.
The 6 tone symmetrical scale is a 6 note division of the octave. It is particularly unique because
of its simplistic scale pattern. Each note of the 6 tone symmetrical scale has a whole tone
in-between. With all the tones equal distance apart from one another, there is no strong feeling of tonality.
There is no one note that the other notes within the scale are centered around. The scale is known for its blurred, indistinct overall sound. The sound is often described as having a “dreamy” quality.

The 6 tone symmetrical scale is also known as the __whole tone scale__ or the __hexatonic scale__.

## The Pattern
The 6 tone symmetrical scale is a series of __major 2nds__ (whole tones).
The pattern is simply: WT-WT-WT-WT-WT-WT. No matter which note you begin on, the pattern will always remain the same. Another way you can think of it is that there will be a half tone in-between each note of the scale. For example, if you started on an E, your next note will be an F# (the F is the half tone in-between the E and F#). The scale continues to move from F# to G# (the G is the half tone in-between). Can you continue the pattern?

> E - F# - G# - A# - C - D


## Getting Started
- Start on any note
- Move to a note one whole tone away
- Continue to play whole tones between pitches
- Count six notes *or* be aware of playing within one octave

For example, if you start on a C, your whole tone scale will be:

> C - D - E - F# - G# - A# - (C).

You can add the top C if you would like although it is not necessary. Remember that there are no set rules (listed here are guidelines to help you). If you wish to play the scale in several octaves, you can do that as well.

- Now try playing the scale backwards
- Once you become familiar with the pitches, try playing them in a different order

What does it sound like? Can you evoke the dreamy and blurred tonal quality that the scale is known for having?

## Played One, Played Them All (well, sort of!)
Now try starting the scale on a different note. For example, D-E-F#-G#-A#-C. Did you notice that the whole tone scale starting on D has the same pitches as the C whole tone scale? The only difference, the notes fall in a different order.

>  C-D-E-F#-G#-A#

>  D-E-F#-G#-A#-C

In fact, there are only __two distinct__ whole tone (6 tone symmetrical) scales. Each consists of the alternate sets of 6 notes.

*Confused? Keep in mind that the C# whole tone scale is the same as the Db whole tone scale. The two scales have different spellings of the same notes.*

There are many benefits to playing scales. Becoming more familiar and comfortable with your instrument are two benefits that justify the importance of scale practice. Whether practicing scales is or is not currently a part of your [routine](http://blog.pitchplay.io/pitchplay/planning-tracking-practice), remembering to [utilize your time](http://blog.pitchplay.io/practice/efficient-practice) to the best of your abilities is something that PitchPlay can help you with.
