## 1. What Is It?

The 6 tone symmetrical scale is a 6 note scale. Each note of the scale has a whole tone
in-between. The scale is considered "symmetrical" because
it divides the octave into 6 notes. This 6 tone symmetrical scale is also referred to as
the __whole tone scale__ or the __hexatonic scale__.

## 2. Why You Need to Know This Scale
Each time you learn a different scale you are training
your muscles to automatically respond to particular sounds or patterns.
This symmetrical scale has a simple pattern. You can, and should try to __visualize__
it even if you do not have your instrument in front of you.

## 3. The Pattern
The 6 tone symmetrical scale is a series of __major 2nds__ (whole tones).
The pattern is simply: WT-WT-WT-WT-WT-WT


## 4. Pick-up and Play
Start on any note and play whole tones between the pitches.  Count 6 notes
or be aware of playing within one octave.
For example, start with the C Whole Tone scale: C-D-E-F#-G#-A#

## 5. Play One, Play Them All (well, sort of!)
Now try the D whole tone scale: D-E-F#-G#-A#-C. Did you notice that it has all the same pitches as the C whole tone scale? The notes simply fall in a different order.

In fact, there are only __two distinct__ Whole Tone (6 tone symmetrical) scales. Each consists of the alternate sets of 6 notes.

*Confused? Keep in mind that the C# Whole Tone scale is the same as the Db Whole Tone scale. The two scales simply have different spellings of the same notes.*


## 6. Starting Anywhere
You should know what the scale is and why you should play it. If you have not tried playing it, you should try to visualize yourself playing it on your instrument.
Pick a note or pick a string and play some 6 tone symmetrical scales!
