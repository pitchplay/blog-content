## 1. What Is It?

The 6 tone symmetrical scale is a six note scale. Each note of the scale has a whole tone
between them. Remember that a whole tone means that there is a note (half-tone) in between each tone. The scale is considered "symmetrical" because
it divides the octave into 6 notes. This symmetrical scale is also referred to as
the __whole tone scale__ or the __hexatonic scale__.

## 2. Why You Need to Know This Scale
Each time you learn a different scale you are training
your muscles to automatically respond to particular sounds or patterns.
This symmetrical scale has a very simple pattern. You can, and should try to, __visualize__
it without even having your instrument in front of you.

## 3. Know the Pattern
The six tone symmetrical scale is a series of __major 2nds__ (whole tones). The pattern looks like this: W-W-W-W-W-W

## 4. Pick-up and Play
Start on any note and play whole tones between the pitches.  Count six notes
or be aware of playing within one octave.
For example, start with the C Whole Tone scale: C-D-E-F#-G#-A#

## 5. Play One, Play Them All (well, sort of!)
Now try the D whole tone scale: D-E-F#-G#-A#-C
Did you notice that it has all the same pitches as the C whole tone scale?
The notes simply fall in a different order.  These same notes appear in the E, F#, G# and A# Whole Tone scales.
In fact, there are only __two distinct__ Whole Tone scales, consisting of the alternate sets of six notes.

##6. Starting Anywhere
You know what the scale is, you know why you should play it, you know the pattern,
you've either tried to play it or visualized playing it on your instrument.
Now, pick a note or pick a string and play some 6 tone symmetrical scales.
