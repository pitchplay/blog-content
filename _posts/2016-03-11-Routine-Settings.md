You have the ability to refine and personalize your practice.
Set your **preferences** for the difficulty and intensity you would like to practice.

Are things too difficult? Or Would you like to set a heavier pace for yourself?
No problem! You can edit your settings any time.

Change your Settings
--------------------

1. Hover over your profile image. The user drop down menu will appear.
2. Click __Settings__.
3. In the left hand menu click __Trainer__.
4. Set your __Intensity__ and __Difficulty__ to your preference.

__Intensity__ is how much practice you want to accomplish every day. Set __Difficulty__ to your approximate
comfort level.
