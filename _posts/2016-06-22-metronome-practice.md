Rhythm is often under-rated both in practice and teaching. Yet, It never hurts to set aside some time to practice strengthening your rhythm. A strong sense of rhythm is one of the distinguishing features of a great musician. In a performance, inconsistent rhythms can lead to feelings of unease. Whatâ€™s the fastest way to rule rhythm? __The metronome__.

## 'Level Up' Your Rhythm Game

Below are three ways that you can strengthen your rhythm with exercises that you can practice. First though, read about one exercise that will increase the effectiveness of your metronome practice and your love of the tool.

### Keep the Beat, Release the Tension

Often times when we are practicing, we build tension in our muscles. So, mindfully working towards releasing tension is one of the best things that you can do while practicing.

Have you ever been to a yoga or meditation class that focuses on breathing? Using a metronome to focus on releasing your tension works similarly to those classes. Metronome concentration exercises do two great things for musicians.

1) They condition our bodies response upon hearing a metronome

2) They influence our focus and concentration when working with the metronome

Using metronome exercises to release tension is a great way to condition the bodies response upon hearing the sound of a metronome. Then, when you use the metronome to work on improving your rhythm, your conditioned body will be more relaxed. A body that relaxes and releases tension at the sound of the metronome is more likely to practice and perform injury free.

#### *Conditioning Exercise*

- Set the metronome to 60 BPM
- Play for 2 bars
  - Use single notes, scales or your reportoire
- Then, for 2 bars (8 counts), focus on releasing tension throughout your body
  - You can modify this to focus on releasing tension from one specific muscle (or group of muscles) at a time
- Repeat!

The above exercise will help you learn to relax when you practice and play.  Additionally, it adds variety to your metronome practice and increases your focus. Metronomes are often associated with maintaining or fixing rhythm and tempo. If the tool is always used to do the same things, your desire and focus while using it wanes. The metronome is an important tool for musicians. Make it a tool that works as a reminder to focus, relax and rule rhythm.

### Keeping the Beat

The beat of a song is similar to the tick-tock of a clock. Finding the beat is like listening for the sound of a clock within a room. You may not recognize it until you focus on it.

Keeping the beat once you find or establish it is very important. The beat works as a reference point for all other rhythms occuring within the music. Finding and keeping the beat within a song is the first step towards being able to maintain an even tempo.

The next time you are listening to [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DohRa9lsx0Q&list=PLK9Sc5q_4K6aNajVLKtkaAB1JGmKyccf2), try finding and keeping the beat.

*If you think keeping the beat in most songs is too simplistic, try songs with [changing metres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAYt-BMUuA8).*

### Internalizing the Beat

Internalizing the beat is important. It ensures that you will be able to maintain a consistent tempo regardless of how much attention you pay to the music.

When you practice internalizing a beat, it is best done by use of your voice. By vocalizing the beat, you ensure that you will always feel the vibrations regardless of how loud or distracting the music is. When you have internalized a beat, you no longer have to rely on your toes, fingers or voice to keep things at a __steady pulse__.

An internalized beat works like a back-up battery. It ensures that the performance continues to run smoothly. With an internalized beat, you do not have to worry about distractions causing you to lose the tempo or rhythm during a performance.

### Subdividing the Beat

To subdivide a beat means to play the rhythmic points in-between the beats. The ability to subdivide makes maintaining the tempo and a consistent pulse (beat) easier. The ability to subdivide can also allow you to alter the way time feels without killing the tempo. If you change the tempo you'll draw the audience out of the performance.

Without subdividing, the spaces between notes can seem like a big stretch of time. This could result in you altering the tempo in anticipation of the next note.

PitchPlay's [metronome](https://pitchplay.io) makes subdivision easy with the ability to set pulses on the subdivisions. You can do this by keeping the subdivisions at half the volume of the beat.

____________________________________________

#### Exercise 1

- Set your [metronome](https://pitchplay.io) to 60 BPM.
- Tap, clap, snap or verbalize the beat of the metronome.
  - Continue until you feel that the sound of the metronome fades (this tells you that your accuracy has improved as your taps line up precisely with the beat).
- Try increasing the BPM of the metronome and repeating the exercise.

#### Exercise 2

- Set your metronome to 60 BPM (can also listen to a song instead of the metronome).
- Keep the beat by vocalizing a count or sound.
- After you feel you have established the beat, mute the metronome or your audio.
- Continue keeping the beat and then unmute the volume. If you've internalized the beat, you should still be in sync with the metronome.
- Add longer times in-between muting and unmuting the volume.
- Change the metronome speed.

#### Exercise 3

- Snap, clap, tap or say the subdivisions of the beat you've set on your metronome (60 BPM).
- You can subdivide the beat into eighth notes to begin with (2 notes in the time of 1 beat)
- Change the tempo of your metronome.
- Try subdividing into triplets or sixteenth notes (fitting 3 or 4 notes into the beat).
- Experiment with switching back and forth between different subdivisions while maintaining the tempo.

*Now that you have done some metronome practice it is time to add another layer of complexity.*

#### Exercise 4

- Pick up your instrument.
- Walk through the above exercises using your instrument to keep the beat.  

These exercises, whether you tap, clap, say or play them, they will give you a stronger sense of rhythm. Furthermore, check out our blog on [polyrhythms](https://pitchplay/music/polyrhythm) to add some variety to your rhythm exercises.
