## Subdivide

Student performers must learn to subdivide for rhythmic accuracy, maintenance of pulse, and to properly execute marching fundamentals.

Let’s assume you’re playing a chart in 4/4 at MM=148. Start by setting the metronome to double the metronome marking, in this case MM=296.  Yes, you could simply turn on the 8th-note subdivider if your metronome has that function.  Rehearse to that tempo to find areas where rhythmic and pulse imprecision occur. Once you know the areas that need to be firmed up metrically, set the metronome to the marked tempo (MM=148). Now we begin making the students really do the subdivision themselves.  Set your metronome to half the marked tempo, or every 1st and 3rd beat (MM=74).  Now the performers have to provide the internal subdivision themselves to ensure they arrive at the major downbeats as an ensemble.  This also works well because the marching performers will have their left foot lining up with each metronome click. Finally, provide the ensemble with only first downbeat of each measure by setting the metronome to 1/4th of the marked tempo (MM=37).

Constant Counting with Subdivisions
Precision rhythmic placement requires the performer to subdivide. Get into the habit of counting, and subdividing, at all times.

Count and subdivide while listening to recordings. Count and subdivide to the rhythm of the washing machine, your windshield wipers, the grooves on the highway…everything. Do it until you find yourself counting and subdividing without even realizing you were doing it.

As a reminder, “counting” means counting with numbers and subdividing with syllables. Simply hearing “clicks” in your head won’t be as effective.

## How to Hear the Pulse

When you listen to a popular song, you can often find the pulse in the lower instruments of the song. For example, the drummer might be hitting the bass drum on all four beats, the pianist could be comping chords in 4/4 time, or there could be a steady walking bass line that helps you easily identify the beat.
Pulse Practice
Now let’s look at two more exercises you can use to practice finding the beat. You will need:
A Metronome, Drum sticks (or a handy substitute – tap with a finger if necessary!) If you do not have a metronome handy, use this online metronome to set the pulse:
Now let’s practice keeping a beat at 60BPM, 40BPM, 80BPM, 120BPM, and 180BPM.
Set the tempo at 60 BPM on your metronome. This is the equivalent of one beat per second and a good tempo to start at since many people have a resting heart rate around 60 BPM.
Use the drumsticks tap a single beat along with the metronome.
You might find that it is difficult to maintain a slow beat. If so, try subdividing by playing 8th notes, meaning two notes per beat. If you aren’t sure what that sounds like, set the tempo to 120 BPM to hear, then adjust back to 60 BPM.
After you have mastered playing along with the metronome for at least five minutes in time, practice at different tempos like 40BPM and 80 BPM. Use subdivisions for slower beats until you are comfortable playing single beats.

## Internal Time Feel

Practicing with a metronome is one of the most important exercises you can do but it is also essential that you develop your own internal time feel!


First set how many "Solid Start Bars" you have to get in the groove before the mute cycle begins. It's very important to have this time to get in the groove, especially when the working on longer bar breaks. You also set how many bars you will have of "Solid Time Bars" which will be followed by "Muted Time Bars".

The default settings are a good place to start - it will give you 4 "Solid Start Bars", followed by 3 "Solid Time Bars" and then 1 "Muted Time Bars".

Once you are confident that you can keep solid time for one bar and come in *perfectly* in sync with the click when they come back in, you might like to make the break 2 bars and as you feel confident with each break you can increase it. But don't rush it - you must get it really perfect or you will practicing making your time worse!!

If you select "Random Bar Mute", the "Random Bar Mute %" is active but the "Solid Time Bars" and "Muted Time Bars" will no longer function. When using this part of the trainer, the set percentage of bars will be randomly muted. This can keep it interesting and at high percentage settings will be very challenging.

To make the most from Bar Break you will probably want to work on your rhythm guitar: strumming, riffing and grooving. You could practice scales along, but you will want to be good with your rhythm first. I do use it for free jamming though, just jamming along improvising a solo and making sure I can hold the beat steady while I play across and around it, but this is a lot more challenging and should only be done when you feel uber confident playing rhythm through the bar breaks.

Random Beat Drop

Learning to play with the metronome is a very important skill. Perhaps the most important when you start working with one. Because of this we get used to the click being there and it feels real strange when it's not... so the idea of this exercise is to start muting some of the beats and develop your inner beat.

For most people (including me) it takes quite some practice before it feels normal, but it will really increase confidence in your time and you will find you play with the metronome beat, not be reliant on it!

Many times I have seen students chasing the click (waiting for it and then trying to play after it's gone) or trying to anticipate the click and rushing. It's important that you do neither! You should be playing alongside the metronome, it's helping you make sure YOUR time is good, like a pace runner, it's next to you to check against, but you really want to keeping your own groove.

You can use this two ways. With "Gradual" set to the off position, the "Beat Drop %" will consistently drop beats at the chosen percentage. This is a good way to start and get used to it.

To build your confidence turn "Gradual" to ON and set a practice duration in "Gradual Interval" (I most often have this set at 5 minutes). It will then gradually increase the muted beats up to the set percentage over the practice session. Doing this you would usually set the % higher than you would for regular practice.

You can use this tool with either rhythm or lead guitar or scale practice. The point is just getting confident with the groove so you don't get freaked out when the click is muted... the challenge is staying really 'locked in' with the metronome.

Speed Upper

When practicing scales or technical exercises, I usually work for a set time (most often 5 minutes) and then every minute or two I have to stop and increase the speed of the metronome. I often wondered why nobody had made one that sped up automatically during a practice session... so I did!

The settings for this are pretty simple, a "Start Tempo", and "End Tempo" and a "Practice Duration". The metronome will start at the "Start Tempo" and gradually and evenly increase the speed during the practice session to the "End Tempo".

It is very important to practice things at a consistent tempo (possibly more important!) because that is what we want when we play. So don't overuse this Speed Up tool or you might find that your playing naturally always speeds up!

## Using The Metronome

Playing with a metronome is an essential skill. When I meet a student that had a problem with rhythm playing or timekeeping, 9 times out of 10 they have not been working with a metronome.

Probably the most basic exercise is simply playing a scale with the metronome. I usually recommend using a major scale, and an intermediate player might start with the metronome set at 80 bpm and just playing one note for each click. Once this is mastered gradually increase the speed until it can be played perfectly at 160 bpm.

Once you can play one note per click at 160 bpm, you should cut the tempo to 80bpm but play two notes per click. This is of course the same speed! Get used to the groove again because it feels a little different, and put the down pick on the click and the up pick in between. Slowly speed the metronome up again as you get things perfect four times in a row until you hit 160 again.

Now you will be playing 4 notes per click (16th notes) at 80bpm. Most people don't get into playing more than 4 notes per click but more advanced players might like to experiment with 5, 6, 7 or more notes per click.

Personally, I never got my speed much past 158 doing 4 notes per click, but many of the rock guys play way faster, so it's up to you to push your limits - but remember that you MUST PLAY PERFECTLY WHEN WORKING ON SPEED DEVELOPMENT or you will be practicing playing badly fast, deepening bad habits, which is just stupid!

## Locking in

A very important concept to be aware of is 'locking in', playing exactly with the metronome. If you play exactly with the click it almost disappears and it's then you'll know you are properly 'locking in' or 'in the pocket' as it's sometimes called.

Some of the true masters of rhythm and time say that there are 3 points to the metronome click, just before, right on and just ahead and that a good player should be able to play a note on any one of these places. This is hard core, and is one of the things I work on myself, it's possible to feel it when you really focus on it, but you have to be able to 'lock in' real well first before experimenting with this! the differences are miniscule, but this is the shizzle that matters when you are trying to perfect your groove!


As important as playing with good intonation is, it is even more important to play with good time and rhythmic accuracy. Most of us know that counting, subdividing and practicing with a metronome can help. However, there are things we can do beyond these initial steps. Below are a few suggestions, and a few games, for taking your rhythmic accuracy to the next level.

## Move While You Play

Accurate rhythm and good time are at least 50% physical, and keeping your body needlessly still can impede your concept of the beat. You don’t have to dance a jig, but moving some part of your body to the beat, (even if it’s just tapping your toe or nodding your head) can help your playing sit firmly in the pocket. Do this for anything you practice that has a beat.

## Count Rhythms Aloud While You Play Them
Playing this rhythm?

Rhythm pattern

Count the rhythm aloud while you play using the numbers and syllables of your preferred counting system. (e.g. One and-a, Two and-a, etc.)Don’t have one yet? Go get one.

Count the rhythms aloud while you play your etudes, repertory and sight reading for a week and see what it does for your rhythmic concept.

Away from the Bass
Keep the Beat Going
Set your metronome to a tempo, say 110bpm, and let it click away.
Tap this tempo with one hand
Use the other hand to reduce volume to zero
Keep the tempo for a time in your “tapping” hand
Turn up the volume and the metronome and see if you kept a steady beat. How long can you keep the beat consistent?
Can you keep the tempo for one bar? Ten bars? One minute?
You can also do this “at the bass.” Simply replace your tapping with a consistent rhythm played on an open string. If you want to try this, I suggest starting with quarter notes.
Recognize Tempi
Use the “tap tempo” function on your favorite metronome (or metronome app) to determine the tempo of your some of your favorite recordings. Put a bpm number to recordings you are already familiar with. Memorize the bpm of a few songs.

Once you start to get a feel for different tempi, start the guessing game on a new batch of recordings. Feel the beat of the song you are listening to, then try to determine the tempo simply by recall. Check your guess against the “tap tempo” function of your metronome (or app). Do this for a few weeks and see how your tempo recall improves. Work to get within 5 bpm below or 5 bpm above.


## 5 Ways to take your rhythm game to the next level

1) Find the steady beat in a song. Practice keeping a beat with rhythm exercises.
2) Basic music theory for rhythm
3) Recognize common rhythms in rock, jazz, Latin music, and more
4) Learn how to count complex meters and rhythms
5) Practice rhythm ear training in a fun way

Get creative, create your own games and challenges.

Which is better? Playing the right pitch at the wrong time or playing
the wrong pitch at the right time?
Rhythm is often under-rated both in practice time and teaching. You may have
tried to justify why you do not want to use a metronome yourself: "it's
annoying," "but i'm counting in my head," "i tap my foot." Have you thought
about the fact that you can shift your mental count or toe tapping to suit
whatever you are playing. The metronome is constant and unforgiving. It will not
shift or fluctuate. Despite metronomes being seen as the neighbor's persistent
and annoying dog that refuses to stop barking, a metronome can be a fun practice
tool that aids in the improvement of your musicality.
Here's where PitchPlay can help. PitchPlay has noted the important things that
we know are useful about the metronome: how it forces you to listen, increases
your awareness of what is happening in the music, how it's relentless time
keeping helps identify problem spots and aids in increasing your agility in
those areas. To make the metronome more interesting we have created games that
make practicing and working with the metronome fun and rewarding. After you use
PitchPlay, you might even find yourself tempted to dust off a metronome and try
out an innovative rhythm game amongst friends.
