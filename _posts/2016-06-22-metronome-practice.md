RRhythm is often under-rated both in practice and teaching. Yet, it never hurts to set aside some time to practice developing or strengthening your rhythmic capabilities. A strong sense of rhythm is one of the distinguishing features of a great musician. In a performance, inconsistent rhythms can lead to feelings of unease. Whatâ€™s the fastest way to rule rhythm? __The metronome__.

## 3 Ways to 'Level Up' Your Rhythm Game

Below are three simple ways you can strengthen your rhythm followed by exercises you can practice.

### Keeping the Beat

The beat of a song is similar to the tick-tock of a clock. Finding the beat is like listening for the sound of a clock within a room. You may not recognize it until you focus on it.

Keeping the beat once you find or establish it is very important. The beat works as a reference point for all other rhythms occuring within the music. Finding and keeping the beat within a song is the first step towards being able to maintain an even tempo.

The next time you are listening to [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DohRa9lsx0Q&list=PLK9Sc5q_4K6aNajVLKtkaAB1JGmKyccf2), try finding and keeping the beat.

*If you think finding and keeping the beat in most songs is too simplistic, try keeping the beat in songs with [changing metres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAYt-BMUuA8).*

### Internalizing the Beat

Internalizing the beat is important. It ensures that you will be able to maintain a consistent tempo regardless of how much attention you pay to the music.

When you practice internalizing a beat, it is best done by use of your voice. By vocalizing the beat, you ensure that you will always feel the vibrations you make regardless of how loud or distracting the music is. When you have internalized a beat, you no longer have to rely on your toes, fingers or voice to keep things at a __steady pulse__.

With the beat internalized in your physical body, if you were to become distracted during a performance, you would not have to worry about losing the tempo or rhythm. Your internalized beat works like a back-up battery ensuring that the performance continues to run smoothly.

### Subdividing the Beat

To subdivide a beat means to play the rhythmic points in-between the beats. The ability to subdivide makes maintaining the tempo and a consistent pulse (beat) easier. The ability to subdivide can also allow you to alter the way time feels without killing the tempo. If you change the tempo you'll draw the audience out of the performance.

Without subdividing, the spaces between notes can seem like a big stretch of time. This could result in you altering the tempo in anticipation of the next note.

PitchPlay's [metronome](https://pitchplay.io) makes subdivision easy with the ability to set pulses on the subdivisions. You can do this by keeping the subdivisions at half the volume of the beat.

____________________________________________

#### Exercise 1

- Set your [metronome](https://pitchplay.io) to 60 BPM.
- Tap, clap, snap or verbalize the beat of the metronome.
  - Continue doing this until you feel that the sound of the metronome fades (this tells you that your accuracy has improved as your taps begin lining up precisely with the beat).
- Try increasing the BPM of the metronome and repeating the exercise.

#### Exercise 2

- Set your metronome to 60 BPM (can also listen to a song instead of the metronome).
- Keep the beat by vocalizing a count or sound.
- After you feel you have established the beat, mute the metronome or your audio.
- Continue keeping the beat and then unmute the volume. If you've internalized the beat, you should still be in sync with the metronome.
- Add longer times in-between muting and unmuting the volume.
- Change the metronome speed.

#### Exercise 3

- Snap, clap, tap or say the subdivisions of the beat you've set on your metronome (60 BPM).
- You can subdivide the beat into eighth notes to begin with (2 notes in the time of 1 beat)
- Change the tempo of your metronome.
- Try subdividing into triplets or sixteenth notes (fitting 3 or 4 notes into the beat).
- Experiment with switching back and forth between different subdivisions while maintaining the tempo.

*Now that you have done some metronome practice it is time to add another layer of complexity.*

#### Exercise 4

- Pick up your instrument.
- Walk through the above exercises using your instrument to keep the beat instead of your voice, hands or feet.  

These exercises, whether you tap, clap, say or play your instrument with them, will give you a stronger sense of rhythm. For more on rhythm, check out the blog on [polyrhythms](https://pitchplay blogasl;falskdfna;lksdgna;gn)
