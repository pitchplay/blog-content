Rhythm is often under-rated both in practice and teaching. A strong sense of rhythm is one of the distinguishing features of a great musician. In a performance, inconsistent rhythms can lead to feelings of unease. Whatâ€™s the fastest way to rule rhythm? __The metronome__.

## 4 Ways to 'Level Up' Your Rhythm Game

#### Finding the Beat

The beat of a song is like the tick-tock of a clock. Finding the beat in a song is like listening for the sound of a clock within a room. You may not feel like you can hear it until you focus on the sound. Listen to a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DohRa9lsx0Q&list=PLK9Sc5q_4K6aNajVLKtkaAB1JGmKyccf2) and find the beat. Clap your hands, snap your fingers or tap your toes.

Maintain following the beat for the entire song. Alternate between clapping, snapping, tapping or verbalizing the beat.

*Exercise 1*

- The next time you are practicing, set the [metronome](https://pitchplay.io) to 60.
- Tap, clap, snap or verbalize the beat. Continue until you feel that the sound of the metronome fades and your accuracy has improved.
- Try speeding up or slowing down the metronome.

#### Internalizing the Beat

When you have internalized a beat, you no longer have to rely on your toes or fingers to keep things at a steady pulse.  Internalizing the beat is important. It ensures that you will be able to maintain a consistent tempo.

*Exercise 2*

- Set your metronome to 60 (can also listen to a song instead of the metronome).
- Keep the beat.
- After you feel you have established the beat, mute the metronome or your audio.
- Continue keeping the beat and then unmute the volume. If you've internalized the beat, you should still be in sync with the metronome.
- Add longer times in-between muting and unmuting the volume.
- Change the metronome speed.

#### Subdividing the Beat

To subdivide a beat means to play the rhythmic points in-between the beats. The ability to subdivide makes maintaining the tempo and a consistent pulse (beat) easier. The ability to subdivide can also allow you to alter the way time feels without killing the tempo. If you change the tempo you'll draw the audience out of the performance.

Without subdividing, the spaces between notes can seem like a big stretch of time. This could result in you altering the tempo in anticipation of the next note.

PitchPlay's [metronome](https://pitchplay.io) makes subdivision easy with the ability to set pulses on the subdivisions. You can do this by keeping the subdivisions at half the volume of the beat.

*Exercise 3*

- Snap, clap, tap or say the subdivisions of the beat you've set on your metronome (60).
  - You can subdivide eighth notes to begin with (2 notes in the time of 1 beat)
- Change the tempo of your metronome.
- Try subdividing with triplets or sixteenth notes (fitting 3 or 4 notes into the beat).
- Experiment with switching back and forth between different subdivisions while maintaining the tempo.

#### Adding Complexity to the Beat

Now that you have done some metronome practice it is time to add another layer of complexity.

*Exercise 4*

- Pick up your instrument.
- Walk through the above exercises using your instrument to keep the beat instead of your hands or feet.  

These exercises, whether you tap, clap or play your instrument with them, will give you a stronger sense of rhythm. For more on rhythm, check out the blog on [polyrhythms](https://pitchplay blogasl;falskdfna;lksdgna;gn)
