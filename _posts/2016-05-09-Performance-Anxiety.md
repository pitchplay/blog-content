Our fear of anxiety and our resourcefulness in attempting to deny or change the
symptoms of anxiety results in an inner battle. The inner battle focuses almost
solely on our anxiety instead of on our performance.

__Performance anxiety is the body’s fight or flight response that kicks in when faced with a performance.__

Although the symptoms and the severity of them vary for every individual, the most common ones are:

* repetitive and or negative thoughts
* a racing pulse
* changes in your breathing
* trembling hands, lips, knees or voice
* nausea or an uneasy feeling

Anyone that has ever tried to combat any or all of these symptoms knows that it is a difficult feat. A common list of suggestions include:

- be better prepared
- limit your caffeine and sugar intake
- focus on friendly faces in the audience
- laugh
- exercise daily and get adequate sleep
- speak to a professional about beta blockers

Have you ever wondered why you were unable to eliminate your performance anxiety even after combining many of the above suggestions?

__The suggestions do not target the “problem.” Instead, they attempt to distract, change or mask it.__

Anxiety is caused by both the way we think and feel. Stress resulting from the feelings and fear of anxiety is “performance anxiety.” By learning how to accept the feelings and fears, you can overcome your anxiety about a performance. It sounds simple: accept the anxiety and you will over come anxiety. So, how do you learn to accept anxiety?

## How Do You Do It?

First, understand that there is nothing wrong with feeling anxious. However, fearing the anxious feeling or allowing anxiety to settle in and consume your thoughts is not helpful.

Many performers, myself included, are guilty of allowing ourselves to suffer with the limitations and stress that having performance anxiety places on us. We will obsess over the feeling and fear of the building anxiety and nervous energy. This results in our stress, fear and feelings distracting us before and/or during our performance. Want to get rid of performance anxiety?

__Start directing your attention to the performance and move it away from the internal anxious battle.__

Dr. David Carbonell, author of [anxietycoach.com](http://www.anxietycoach.com/) explains our tendency to engage in
the inner battle and distract ourselves from our performances.

>[Performance anxiety] stems from a tendency to resist and
fight your anxiety, rather than to accept and work with it. It is like being
heckled mercilessly during your performance, and getting into an argument with the heckler,
except that it's your own mind doing the heckling. You get so involved in your internal struggle
that you don't get involved with the actual performance. Most people with performance anxiety fright
get tricked into focusing on themselves, struggling against anxiety in a vain effort to get rid of it.


## The Performance

Have you ever welcomed the rush of anxious energy you feel before stepping on a stage? Did you know you could use your anxious energy to your advantage?

Before stepping out on stage, gather all of your energy. This includes the excitement, fear, nervousness, all of those emotions. Imagine drawing them into a centre or focal point within your body. Some people use their belly button as a gathering place for the energy.

Once gathered, imagine pushing it upwards. Release the energy through your hands, eyes, mouth or the top of your head. Once the energy is released, you may still feel it but you should no longer fear it. That energy is your performance fuel. It will charge your performance with emotion and it will no longer drain you of your performance concentration. Now, direct all of your attention to the performance.

__Allow any anxious feelings and or fear to be present within or around you, but do not let them concern you.__

Remember, it is okay to feel anxious about a performance but, focusing on the anxiety is harmful. A lot of our feelings in regards to performance anxiety are [habitual responses](http://moodsmith.com/online-therapy-anxiety/) to a situation.

__Stop analyzing the way your anxiety effects you and take your performance focus and concentration to the next level.__
