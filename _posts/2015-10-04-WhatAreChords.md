A chord is a combination of two or more notes played simultaneously. There you go! That's the end of the blog.

Kidding, of course. Chords are, by definition, very simple. But they come in all shapes and flavours! On a piano, the most common chord for any beginner to learn is the major chord whereas many guitarists 
tend to learn the easy-to-play two note "power chord".

Chords are constructed of notes that come from a scale. For instance, the C major scale, which is arguably the most popularly taught first scale, is made up of the following notes (and the intervals those notes represent):

 - C (root note)
 - D (major second)
 - E (major third)
 - F (perfect fourth)
 - G (perfect fifth)
 - A (major sixth)
 - B (major seventh)
 - C (octave/perfect eighth)\*

*\* Technically speaking, the second `C` (perfect eighth) is the beginning of the next octave of the scale, but I'm including it here because many chords (especially in the guitar world) make use of octaves.*

When we define a chord, we usually refer to its composition not by the specific notes, but by the intervals that are used. For a primer on intervals, read [this]. The Cole's Notes is that intervals are the gaps between notes and they're listed above as: `major second, major third, ...`. Each of these intervals above are relative to the `root note`. If you started counting on `D` instead of `C` then the difference between `D -> E` would be a major second and `D -> F` would be a major third.

So, back to chords. A major chord is always comprised of three notes (otherwise known as a "triad"):

Root  
Major Third  
Perfect Fifth  

Let's make a `C Major` chord! Looking at the list above we see that `C` is the root note. We know we need a major third and a perfect fifth. Without reading further, can you figure out which three chords make up the `C Major` triad?

If not, that's OK! The answer is:

```C E G```

 Now you can play a `C Major` chord simply by finding those three notes and playing them in unison. Likewise, if you see those three notes appear vertically aligned on a staff then you know you what you are dealing with!

 Chords have lots of variants like: `minor` (where the major third is flatted to a minor third), and `Major 7th` (where we add a major seventh to the triad). Chords have many variants; this list is hardly exhaustive!

 Now that you've gotten a taste about what chords are, you may find it useful to refresh your memory about scales and intervals!
