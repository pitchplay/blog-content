A **chord** is a combination of two or more notes played simultaneously. There you go! That's the end of the blog.

Kidding, of course. Chords are, by definition, very simple, but they come in all shapes and flavours. On a piano, the most common chord for any beginner to learn is the three-note **major chord** whereas many guitarists tend to learn the easy-to-play two-note **power chord**.

Chords are constructed of notes that come from a **scale**. For instance, the **C Major** scale, which is arguably the most popularly taught first scale, is made up of the following notes (and the intervals those notes represent):

 - C (Root Note - R)
 - D (Major Second - M2)
 - E (Major Third - M3)
 - F (Perfect Fourth - P4)
 - G (Perfect Fifth - P5)
 - A (Major Sixthor - M6)
 - B (Major Seventh - M7)
 - C (Octave/Perfect Eighth - P8)

When we define a chord, we usually refer to its composition not by the specific notes, but by the **intervals** that are used. For a primer on intervals, read [this]. The Cole's Notes is that intervals are the names we give the distances between notes.

So, back to chords. A major chord is always comprised of three intervals:

Root (R)  
Major Third (M3)  
Perfect Fifth (P5)

Let's make a **C Major** chord! Looking at the list above we see that **C** is the root note. We know we also need a **major third** and a **perfect fifth**. Without reading further, can you figure out which three chords make up the C Major chord?

If not, that's OK! The answer is:

**C E G**

Now you can play a C Major chord simply by finding those three notes on your instrument and playing them in unison. Likewise, if you see those three notes appear vertically aligned on a staff then you know what you are dealing with!

Chords have lots of variants like: **minor** (where the **major third** is flatted to a **minor third**), and **major seventh** (where we add a **major seventh** to the chord making it a four-note chord). Chords have many variants; this list is hardly exhaustive!

Now that you've gotten a taste about what chords are, you may find it useful to refresh your memory about [scales] and [intervals]!
