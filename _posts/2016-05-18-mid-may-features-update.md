Do you need more incentive to practice? Create a social network to help inspire you on PitchPlay. With an activity feed on your dashboard and the ability to follow and be followed, you'll find yourself more easily hitting your practice goals for the end of this month.

## Follow and Followers

Motivate and prepare to be motivated by following your friends on PitchPlay. Go to your profile, copy your URL and send it to friends.

To get to your profile, hover over your profile image on the far right of your screen and click __Profile__.

Copy your URL. Chances are it looks something like mine, only with your name:

__[https://pitchplay.io/user/hayley-macleod](https://pitchplay.io/user/hayley-macleod)__

Send your URL link to friends so that they can follow you. Once you receive a friend's URL link, you can go to their profile and follow them. Following a friend will enable their activity on PitchPlay to show up in your activity feed. If you are being followed by friends, your activity will show up in their activity feeds.

## Activity Feed

The activity feed is one way you can stay up-to-date on what has been going on in PitchPlay's social world. You'll see when friends practice, follow and are followed. Additionally, you'll see your own practice sessions populating within your feed.

## <center> New Tools in Your Practice Canvas

### Mirror

Practicing in front of a mirror is a great way to recognize bad habits. Use our __mirror tool__ to keep your technique and posture on point. While in the practice canvas, you can click the camera icon along the top right row and enable your webcam.

### Self-Recorder

It can be difficult to be analytical of your performance while you are playing. That's one of the reasons we added the __self-record tool__.

Use the self-record tool to record yourself and then listen back to your recording. Analyzing is not the only use for this tool. Additional uses include:

* help with memorizing,
* harmonizing,
* composing and
* layering

Because we have set the self-record tool to loop back, your hands are free to work with your instrument. No need to rewind or press play again. Along the top right row of your practice canvas, click the recording icon to enable the self-record tool.

A bar will pop up on the bottom of your screen. To record, press the red button. The button will pulse while recording. To stop recording, press the button again and then hit play to hear your recording.
