## Music is an Intellectual Reward

Music is an exercise for your whole brain. The brain gathers and stores information on every piece of music you hear. This information is stored on [musical memory templates](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/04/11/why-does-music-feel-so-good/). As soon as you hear music, your brain works to find connections to music you have heard in the past. Recognizable patterns, themes, and your emotional response to a piece of music are all stored on the memory templates.

When you hear a new song, your brain tries to find similarities to other songs you know. Searching through its storage of past songs, the brain looks for similar melodic patterns or rhythms. If a similarity is found, the new song is compared to it. You will be able to better __predict patterns__ and __anticipate__ where the music is going through these comparisons.  

Additionally, our emotional response to new songs is determined by our musical memory templates. If a new song shares similarities to one you had an __emotional connection__ with in the past, you will feel a similar emotional connection to the new song.

## Neurochemical Bliss

Have you ever heard music referred to as "a natural drug of happiness?"

When we hear our favorite song, an influx of feel good neuro-chemicals are found in our brain. Hearing the music we love results in a reward response and [dopamine](http://news.discovery.com/human/psychology/music-dopamine-happiness-brain-110110.htm) is released. Dopamine results in feelings of happiness and satisfaction. Like sex or your favorite food, listening to music you enjoy triggers the reward response.

## The Social Badge

Psychologists and neuroscientists have discovered that our brains [bind](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/08/musical_nostalgia_the_psychology_and_neuroscience_for_song_preference_and.html) us to the music we listen to. This binding is more prevalent in our teenage years than during adulthood. Some scientists believe that this is the result of how __intertwined__ music is in our social lives as teenagers.

As teenagers, we discover who we are and we relate our own lives to those of our friends. Listening to the same or similar music as friends is representational of belonging to a particular social group.

#### *Music melds into our sense of identity.*

Although not completely understood, our love for music is ever prevalent. Furthermore, every individualâ€™s connection to music is unique. Our relationship with music is rooted to our experiences. The intellectual, emotional and social factors that connect us to music are different for every individual.

Do you know someone that doesn't enjoy music? Do you find them harder to relate to?
