How do you get better at practicing? You can begin by analyzing all of the ways
in which you have been practicing inefficiently. So, before we discover how to
make the most of your practice sessions, it is helpful to recognize some common
practice habits:

## The Broken Record Method
Do you find yourself repeating the same thing over and over? It may seem like
practice but it is often mindless repetition.

## The Autopilot Method
Do you activate your autopilot system and coast through your practices? This
commonly happens when running through a piece from beginning to end. Sometimes,
you can't even recall playing through sections of the piece.

## The Hybrid Method
Perhaps you have taken on a hybrid of the two where you combine the broken
record and autopilot methods. This results in an autopilot play through until
a mistake is found, bumping you out of autopilot and throwing you into broken
record method where you drill a passage until it begins to sound better and you
can again resume autopilot.

## So What's The Problem Anyways?
The biggest problem is that your brain is not remaining engaged while you are
practicing. When you are engaged, you will be less bored and more productive.
Becoming engaged is largely a matter of setting goals and knowing how to work
towards achieving them. You must be monitoring your performance and critically
looking for ways to improve. Practicing mindlessly is a dull chore.

I had an adult student who first came to me very excited about learning the
violin. He had spent some time with online video tutorials and knew a few songs
but he wanted to know more. At first, he worked on the technical stuff we talked
about and for a little while he got better. Then, he lost the habit of
practicing and lessons became his 30 min practice for the week. After a couple
of weeks I explained to him that if he could get in the habit of enjoying just
picking up the violin again that he could begin to work on the parts that seemed
like a chore starting with three minutes of open string practice keeping an even
bow speed, then two minutes of open string practice keeping a straight bow. I
set him very specific targets with short times and even though he was practicing
for very little time, he met every single goal each week.

There are a few tools that you can use to help you keep track of your practice
goals. _PitchPlay_ Schedule your practice sessions. As useful as this tip may
be, it must be subsidiary to the rule of only practicing when the mind can best
concentrate. For many people, this is first thing in the morning. Not only is
the mind fresh, but you’ll have a feeling of accomplishment having started your
day by completing a major task, not to mention an emotionally rewarding one.

Have you ever heard someone say “practice smarter, not harder?” Take their
 advice. When you practice unproductively for hours and those hours build across
 days for weeks, you begin practicing mistakes and bad habits increasing the
 chance of having an undesirable performance. As time goes on, cleaning up these
bad habits gets more and more difficult. Furthermore, the more you practice
mindlessly, the lower your confidence dips as you begin to realize that you
don't know how to produce the results you are looking for. The sense of
uncertainty sticks and just won't go away.

When you know why you play something correctly or incorrectly, you have
identified the technical or mechanical factors that are necessary to play the
passage perfectly every time. This results in the development of confidence
because you’ll know that it isn’t a coincidence when you get it right.

Practice slowly. It is a known psycho-physiological fact that the brain cannot
 absorb musical information in detail when playing fast. It is therefore
 essential to work slowly and carefully at all times. Never try to force speed,
 as such attempts are harmful both to the memory and to acquiring velocity.

Don’t allow yourself the ‘luxury’ of mistakes. Mistakes cost far too much time
to repair and only create uncertainty, whereas your practice ought to build
security. Remember, your performance is a direct result of how you practice, and
efficient piano practice means playing correctly. If you start making mistakes,
it means either that you’re going too fast to learn the music or that your brain
is tired. If that’s the case, it’s best to take a break and do
 something—anything—else.
Practice only short passages. The brain absorbs musical information much more
readily when it is not overwhelmed by quantity. Each day, practice just one
passage, and practice it extremely carefully and thoroughly. This makes for
far more efficient piano practice in the long run.
