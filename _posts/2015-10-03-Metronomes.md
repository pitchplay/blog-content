You should practice with a metronome. It's true - although many people don't take the time, metronomes are incredibly useful tools. Which leads us to suggestion number one:

**1. Have a metronome ready to go**   
Seems kind of like a no-brainer, I know. But if you don't leave a metronome nearby to your instrument then when you go to practice or play it is way too easy to forget about. Out of sight, out of mind, right?

**2. Use a metronome app**  
"There's an app for that." Trendy marketing speak aside, it has almost certainly become a truism. Whether you use Android, Apple, Microsoft, or other products, metronomic and tuning apps (generally) abound. Keeping a metronome ready to go on your phone, computer, or tablet is a great way to ensure that you are fulfilling suggestion #1. Most people these days have a smartphone or computer near them almost all day. Take advantage of that fact! PitchPlay was designed around the idea that musical tools and coaching should be available to musicians in a convenient package, so consider [checking us out]!

**3. Make a metronome fun**  
Does this sound like an oxymoron? By definition, most people equate metronome usage with boring old practice. Again, this is where PitchPlay might help you since our reason for existing is to put the fun back in musical activities and training. But even with a simple metronome setup and your own collection of favourite scales, arpeggios, patterns, progressions (or whatever!) you can reframe your approach and make it a fun challenge. Start at a comfortable BPM (beats per minute) setting and work on a passage. Play it cleanly, then move the BPM up 5 of 10 beats. Play it again cleanly. Still no problem? Keep going. Keep going until you reach a level that pushes your comfort zone for speed. Not only can this be a fun way to develop speed and accuracy, but it also helps to solidify your skills at a slower tempo. Think about it - if you can play something at 180bpm, then you certainly shouldn't have any problems playing it at 160bpm!

The metronome is an incredibly useful tool for helping us develop good timing skills and if we re-think the way we use it then we also realize it can become a very powerful tool for pushing ourselves into new levels of playing. Developing speed is not the same as developing feel, but anytime you're working with your instrument in a way that emphasizes speed, accuracy, and overall clean playing then you are contributing to the development of your feel for your instrument, music in general, and playing at different tempos. The metronome: pick it up, turn it on, and go have fun!
