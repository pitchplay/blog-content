Well look at that, a site overhaul!

We're bringing PitchPlay to you with a much sleeker design and better user experience.

Dashboard
---------

The main page you hit when logging in has been reworked to provide a much clearer focus on what you have lined up. Clicking on a day will expand the context to give you what specific practice activities are set.

Also, there are now quick **practice statistics** available on the upper right.

Coming Soon: IMAGE

Calendar
--------

While the calendar may be gone off of the dashboard, a more full featured one exists. It is accessible by clicking on the *Full History* link.

Coming Soon: IMAGE
