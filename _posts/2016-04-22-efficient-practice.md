How do you get better at practicing? You can begin by analyzing the ways
in which you have been practicing. So, before we discover how to
make the most of your practice sessions, it is helpful to recognize some **common
practice habits**.

## The Broken Record Method
Do you find yourself repeating the same thing over and over? It may seem like
practice but it is often __mindless repetition__.

## The Autopilot Method
Do you activate your autopilot system and __coast__ through your practices? This can happen
when running through a piece or a set of tunes from beginning to end. Sometimes,
you can't even recall playing through sections of particular pieces.

## The Hybrid Method
Perhaps you have taken on a hybrid of the two methods. This could result in mindlessly playing through a piece until
a mistake is found. The mistake might bump you out of autopilot and throw you into a broken
record method. You might find yourself drilling a passage until it begins to sound better. Then, you will likely resume autopilot.

## So What's The Problem?
The biggest problem is that your brain is not remaining __engaged__ while you are
practicing. If you practice mindlessly, you are wasting valuable time.
 When you are mentally engaged during your practice, you will be more productive.
Becoming engaged is accomplished by __setting goals__ and knowing how to work
towards achieving them. You must be monitoring your practice and critically
looking for ways to improve your playing.

## Ignite the Ambition ![](/assets/img/2016-04-22/ignite.jpg){:width="75%"}

Do not overwhelm yourself with your desire to be playing a difficult piece or to have mastered a
particular technique. You can fall out of the habit of practicing if you become overwhelmed
by everything you feel you need to accomplish. Always take the time to direct yourself with small,
focused and manageable goals.

## Mistakes are Expensive

Mistakes not only cost your time to repair but they risk your confidence in your abilities.
Practicing should build you **security** in your performances. If you are making mistakes when you are
practicing, it means
that you are going too fast to learn the music or that your brain is tired. So, you need to
slow down or take a break.

## Practice Efficiently

So, where will you be in two months if you can keep your brain actively engaged during practice sessions?
What level will you achieve if you can maintain consistent practice and
set small, manageable goals?
