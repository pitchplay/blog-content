Have you ever used a map to get to your destination? Creating a practice routine is like being guided by a map. You begin by determining where you are (point A) and then, discover where you want to get to (point B). Knowing point A and B each time you begin creating a routine prevents you from getting lost along the way.

## Where Am I, Where Do I Want to Be?

You know yourself better than I do! Take a moment and think about where you are and where you would like to be. It is important to know both point A and B. Otherwise, your journey, your practice session, has little to no direction. This will prevent you from feeling like you are improving.

## Variety is the Spice of ... My Routine?

You wouldn’t go to the gym and workout the exact same group of muscles every day would you? Practicing your instrument is no different. Doing bicep curls every day won’t get you the body of your dreams. Why would you expect working on one thing with music would make you into the musician you always wanted to be?

On __PitchPlay__, we’ve listed five different activity types to help you be the most fit you’ve ever been. Covering every single activity type each time you practice is counter-productive and exhausting. Trying to include two or three activity types helps you achieve a full body workout. Read more about the different activity types [here](http://blog.pitchplay.io/pitchplay/planning-tracking-practice).


#### *Try this 3-step process to build your practice routine today.*

#### Step 1:

Make time. You can not practice without setting aside some time specifically targeted towards practicing.

#### Step 2:

Getting to ‘point B’ is your target while practicing and the routine you build will help you get there. Create your own exercises. The options are endless and there are only two things to keep in mind:

1) Will this move me towards point B?

2) What sort of activity type can this exercise be classified as?

Creating your own exercises allows you to apply your own creativity. This kind of creativity moves you closer to your own unique voice. By always doing someone else’s exercises, you are moving in someone else's direction.

Sometimes it helps to draw ideas from other people but creating your own exercises will take you to where you want to go. On __PitchPlay__ you can write yourself a reminder as to how the exercise relates to getting you to where you want to be. Seeing notes in your practice canvas works to keep you on track and helps you avoid mindless practicing.

#### Step 3:

Create another exercise and another one. I often create my exercises out of my repertoire. I’ll use the notes on the page with different rhythms, articulations or in different sequences to try and achieve what I want.

## What Does It Look Like?

Here's an example of a routine I created last night.

__Point A:__ Currently struggling with a section of my Bach repertoire with large intervals between notes. I have to do a string crossing in-between each note.

__Point B:__ Want to be able to smoothly play the section of my Bach rep with consistency, accuracy and a nice tone.

#### Exercise 1: String Crossings
- string crossings (use open strings)
- record and listen back (analyze for even tone)
- adjust, do again until satisfied with improvement

Activity type: *Technique*

#### Exercise 2: Extended Intervals
- knowing the intervals I'm playing (use specific intervals in repertoire)
- play the first note and sing the second one
- test to ensure I achieved the proper interval

Activity type: *Musicianship*

#### Exercise 3: Slow Accuracy
- at BPM = 52 play difficult passage from rep with a metronome
- look for an even, consistent tone
- once consistency is achieved, move the metronome up a notch

Activity type: *Repertoire*

Can you see how connected my exercises are to what I want to achieve? It is important to keep point B in mind. But, don't obsess. If you are not accomplishing what you want, take a break and re-adjust what you are doing as necessary. Have fun!
