Any lost traveller loves a good map. Creating a practice routine is like being guided by a good map through a foreign city. You begin by determining where you are (point A) and then, discover where you want to get to (point B). But, we aren't all cartographers. It's just as easy to get lost planning a practice as it is to get lost when following a map. Knowing the easiest way to get from point A to B will keep you on track.

## Where Am I, Where Do I Want to Be?

You know yourself better than anyone! Take a moment and think about where you are and where you would like to be. It is important to know both 'point A' and 'B.' Otherwise, your journey, your practice session, has little to no direction. This will prevent you from feeling like you are improving.

## Variety is the Spice of ... My Routine

Sometimes you want to take the scenic route. You will get to the same destination but the route you take to get there is completely different. The same can be said about practicing your instrument. Working on the __same things__ in the __same way__ day after day will not make you into the musician you always wanted to be.

On [PitchPlay](https://pitchplay.io) we've listed five types of activities that will keep your time playing your instrument interesting. Remember, there's only so much you can get done in one practice session. Doing every type of activity can be counter-productive. Trying to include two or three types of activities will help you remain engaged.

Read more about the different activity types [here](http://blog.pitchplay.io/pitchplay/planning-tracking-practice).


#### *Try this 3-step process to build your practice routine today.*

#### Step 1:

Make time. You can not practice without setting aside some time specifically targeted towards practicing.

#### Step 2:

Getting to 'point B' is your target while practicing and the routine you build will help you get there. The options are endless and there are only two things to keep in mind:

1) Will this move me towards 'point B?'

2) What type of activity is this?

Get creative! Create your own exercises. This moves you closer to finding your own unique voice. By always doing someone else’s exercises, you are moving in someone else's direction, taking the beaten path.

Sometimes it helps to draw ideas from other people but creating your own exercises will take you to where you want to go. On [PitchPlay](https://pitchplay.io) you can write yourself a reminder as to how the exercise relates to getting you to where you want to be. Seeing notes in your practice canvas works to keep you on track and helps you avoid mindless practicing.

#### Step 3:

Create another exercise and then another one! I'll often create my exercises out of my repertoire. I use the pitches on the page with different rhythms, articulations or in different sequences to try and achieve what I want.

## So, What Does It All Look Like?

Here's an example of a routine I created last night.

__Point A:__ Currently struggling with a section of my repertoire with large intervals between notes. I have to do a string crossing in-between each note.

__Point B:__ Want to be able to smoothly play the section of my rep with consistency, accuracy and a nice tone.

#### Exercise 1: String Crossings (*Technique*)
- string crossings (using open strings)
- record and analyze for even tone
- adjust, repeat until satisfied with improvement

When working on technique I remind myself to stay focused specifically on a single technique (string crossings) so that I can improve faster.

#### Exercise 2: Extended Intervals (*Musicianship*)
- identifying intervals (in repertoire)
- play the first note and sing the second
- test to ensure proper interval is achieved

Knowing what intervals sound like and being able to sing or hear them in your head will improve your pitch accuracy and build your overall musicianship skills.

#### Exercise 3: Slow Accuracy (*Repertoire*)
- set metronome to BPM = 52
- play difficult passage with slow metronome
- listen for, consistent tonality

Despite 'Repertoire' indicating an entire piece of music, I'm focusing my practice on something specific to ensure my improvement. Once I achieve a consistent sound at a slow speed, I'll bump up the metronome a couple notches and begin looking for that same consistency.

My exercises connect me to my goals the same way a map gets you from one place to another. It is important to keep your destination in mind. However, don't obsess. If you are not accomplishing what you want, take a break and re-adjust what you are doing.

But most important: have fun!
