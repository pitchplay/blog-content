Have you ever used a map to get to your destination? Creating a practice routine is like being guided by a map. You begin by determining where you are (point A) and then, discover where you want to get to (point B). Knowing point A and B each time you begin creating a routine prevents you from getting lost along the way.

You wouldn’t go to the gym and workout the exact same group of muscles every single day would you? Practicing your instrument is no different. Doing bicep curls every day won’t get you the body of your dreams. Why would you expect working strictly on repertoire would make you into the musician you always wanted to be?

On PitchPlay, we’ve listed five different activity types to help you be the most fit you’ve ever been. Covering every single activity type each time you practice is counter-productive and exhausting. Trying to include two or three activity types helps you achieve a full body, energizing workout. Read more about the different activity types here (LINK TO BLOG).

Try this 4-step process to build today’s practice routine.

##Step 1:

Make time. You can not practice without setting aside some time specifically targeted towards practicing.

##Step 2:

Keep your ‘point B’ goal in mind and at the same time, be aware that ‘point B’ is only one point on a map and you will be doing some traveling this season. Getting to ‘point B’ is your target while practicing, the routine you build will help you get there.

##Step 3:

Choose a couple activity types that you feel would help move you towards where you want to be. Once you have chosen a couple activity types, it will be easier to think of an exercise related to where you want to get to. On PitchPlay you can write yourself a reminder as to how the exercise relates to getting you there. Seeing the notes in your practice canvas works as a great reminder to keep you on track and avoid mindless practice and inefficient practice.

##Step 4:

Re-adjust as necessary. It is important to remember to keep realigning yourself with your goals. Determine whether you can tighten up your time frames or whether you need to expand them to meet your goal. Observing this will help you in your ability to create and meet goals in the most efficient ways possible.

If you find yourself setting goals and regularly not achieving them, don’t stress. This is very common and the worst thing you can do is to stop setting goals or give up altogether. Instead, figure out why you aren’t achieving your goals. Ask yourself if you could achieve it with more time, was the goal too broad (were you able to accomplish a portion of it but not it in entirety). Were you too unfocused? These questions can help you redirect your goals into something that is a little more manageable and achievable.
