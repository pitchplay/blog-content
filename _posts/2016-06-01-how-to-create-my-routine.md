Have you ever used a GPS to get to your destination? Did you arrive via the fastest route or the most use of freeways? Creating a practice routine can be thought of with the analogy of a map. You begin by determining where you are (point A) and then, discover where the destination you want to get to is (point B). Knowing point A and B each time you begin creating a routine can help prevent you from getting lost along the way.

Probably the most important component of creating your routine is setting goals. Goals give you targets to aim for and accomplishment of goals shows your progress.

Setting goals, knowing what to practice and how to plan out your practice routine, may all be easier with the help of a private instructor but it is not impossible for you to do on your own. A lot of the work an instructor would do for you, you have the capacity to determine and discover.

You wouldn't go to the gym and workout the exact same group of muscles every single day would you? Practicing your instrument is no different. If doing bicep curls every day won't get you the body of your dreams, why would you expect working strictly on repertoire would make you into the musician you always wanted to be?

On PitchPlay, we've listed five different activity types to help you be the most fit you've ever been. While covering every single activity type each time you practice is counter-productive and exhausting, trying to include 2 or 3 helps you achieve that full body, energizing workout. With your destination in mind, create your routine to guide you from point A to point B. Read more about the different activity types here (LINK TO BLOG).

Now that you know why setting a goal destination is a important and essential when creating a routine, try this 4 step process to build today's routine.

## Step 1:
Make time.
You can not practice without setting aside some time specifically targeted towards practicing.

## Step 2:
Keep your 'point B' goal in mind and at the same time, be aware that 'point B' is only one point on a map and you will be doing some traveling this season. Getting to 'point B' is your target while practicing, the routine you build will help get you there.  

## Step 3:
Choose a couple activity types that you feel would be fitting of exercises that are going to get you on your way to achieving your goal. Write yourself a reminder as to how the exercise relates to getting you there. On PitchPlay, this is easy to do and seeing the notes in your practice canvas works as a great reminder to keep you on track and avoid mindless practice and wasting time.

## Step 4:
Re-adjust as necessary. It is important to remember to keep realigning yourself with your goals. Determine whether you can tighten up your time frames or whether you need to expand them to meet your goal. Observing this will help you in your ability to create and meet goals the most efficiently. 

If you find yourself setting goals and regularly not achieving them, don't stress. This is very common and the worst thing you can do is to stop setting goals or give up altogether. Instead, figure out why you aren't achieving your goals. Ask yourself if you could achieve it with more time, was the goal too broad (were you able to accomplish a portion of it but not it in entirety). Were you too unfocused? These questions can help you redirect your goals into something that is a little more manageable and achievable.
