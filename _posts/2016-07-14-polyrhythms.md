So you want to get better at rhythms, eh? Gain a little independence between your hands? Polyrhythms are a great way to start. A polyrhythm is two different rhythmic patterns played simultaneously against one another. For example, a pianist playing Phillip Glass' *Mad Rush* must play a polyrhythm within the first bar.

Notice how the right hand (top staff) is playing a triplet rhythm while the left hand (bottom staff) plays eighth notes. The two hands play different rhythms at the same time and tempo. Listen to the sound clips to hear how the right hand and left hand sound when played separately.

When you are playing polyrhythms, you must learn to divide your attention between the two rhythms. Practicing polyrhythms helps create hand independence which is important on any instrument that uses both of your hands but particularly important in cases where each hand is doing something different from the other. Additionally, hand independence helps with co-ordination and rhythmic precision. Listen to how the two hands come together to form a polyrhythm (the use of the pedal has not been added to the tracks).

When you are listening to polyrhythms, your attention tends to fall on the individual beats within the two rhythms and you become entranced by the resulting pattern. Polyrhythms are known for their hypnotic character. It may be why we enjoy listening to them as much as we want to get better at playing them.

To begin working on polyrhythms, start with the most basic, 2 against 3.

## 2:3

This polyrhythm is most commonly heard in Sub-Saharan African music traditions. In most Western metres and rhythms, the primary beat is emphasized. However, Sub-Saharan rhythms emphasize the secondary beats. This often causes the Western listener to misinterpret the secondary beats as the primary beats. The Westerner's ear hears and believes the primary beats to be cross-beats. This causes the metre and rhythm to seem to be in a state of contradiction. This contradictory feeling is why polyrhythms are, at first, tricky to play.

There are many different polyrhythms and this post explores three of the most popular. Whether you are looking to recognize polyrhythms within the music you listen to or perform them, each polyrhythm that you are able to understand and [play](http://youtu.be/qimueSJyAhY) helps.

### Pen and Paper

If you are ever confused about how to play or notate a polyrhythm, the best thing you can do is get out the pen and paper to draw yourself an example.

If I'm looking at the 2:3 polyrhythm I want to figure out when the pattern will repeat so that I know what a pattern cycle looks like. I multiply 2x3 to get 6 and then I know that there is a cycle of 6 little beats before both the 2 and 3 rhythms line up on the same beat again.

#### xxxxxx

#### xxxxxx

I draw myself two rows of 'x's. The top row represents my left hand (the 2 rhythm) and the bottom row represents my right hand (the 3 rhythm).


If the top line represents 2, every 2 x's I'm going to clap. I'll represent a clap with an 'l.'
If the bottom line represents 3, every 3 x's I'm going to clap (l). The resulting pattern looks like this:

#### lxlxlx

#### lxxlxx

Now I can practice with a guide if I am having a difficult time understanding or playing the polyrhythm.

## 4:3

![](/assets/img/2016-07-15/4_3staff.png){:width="90%"}

It is not just Africian styles of music that incorporate the use of polyrhythms. Polyrhythms are found in jazz, pop, rock, metal and dance music. This polyrhythm has one rhythm with a 4 count paired up with another rhythm with a 3 count and it is popular within today's pop music. The rhythm is demonstrated in the above image of 4 dotted eights played at the same time as 3 quarter notes. Although many polyrhythms can be written different ways and in different metres, the concept of playing 4 over 3 remains the same.

Online bass educator, Adam Neely, has a great [video example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtZ74JdxCt0) of the 4:3 polyrhythm used in the context of contemporary music. Recognizing the 4:3 polyrhythm opens up your ears. You may suddenly find yourself hearing the polyrhythm in more songs than you would have imagined. Practicing the polyrhythm is one way you can get better at hearing it in context.

Again, I use a diagram to help remind myself of how the polyrhythm works with both of my hands. I know the full pattern is 12 little beats in length (4x3 = 12). Remember that each line represents one hand. The top line refers to the 4 rhythm and the bottom line refers to the 3 rhythm.

## 5:4

![](/assets/img/2016-07-15/5_4staff.png){:width="90%"}

Like the other polyrhythms, the 5:4 polyrhythm is also used in many different styles of music. Like all the other polyrhythms, becoming familiar with both how it sounds and how to play it yourself will sharpen your rhythmic capabilities. This polyrhythm has the longest cycle before both rhythms land on the same beat again. The better you get at it and the faster you are able to play it, the more sense it makes when you can hear the pattern as a whole.

Once you get the hang of it, try switching the hands that you clap the 5 and 4 rhythm with.

### Two Rhythms Don't Equal Polyrhythm

Notice in the above example of a 5:4 polyrhythm that the two rhythms are not lining up on the same beats. Sometimes we may see rhythms that both appear to be different but their differences do not necessarily make them polyrhythms. To be characterized as a polyrhythm, a rhythm must have a cross-pulse. Rhythms that are divisible (the eighth notes divide evenly into the quarter notes, for example) are not considered polyrhythms. The example below demonstrates two different rhythms that divide evenly into one another. Look and listen to the example and compare it to the polyrhythms you have looked at and heard so far.

All of the above polyrhythms and any more that you can think of can be practiced to get better at them. Polyrhythms are easy to practice anywhere. You just need a couple hands or feet.  

### Metronome Practice

The most accurate way to practice any polyrhythm is with a [metronome](https://pitchplay.io). The metronome's unforgiving maintenance of the beat will make sure that you stay in time and on tempo. Below is a 2:3 polyrhythm metronome exercise you can practice.

*2:3 Exercise*

- Set your metronome to a slow BPM (40-50).
- Begin by tapping eighths for each beat of the metronome.
- Speak the triplet value over the steady eighths.
  - sometimes verbalizing the rhythm can help, try "George Washington"
- Now try adding the triplet value you are speaking to your other hand.
- Once you are getting the hang of it, switch hands.
- Increase the tempo of the metronome.

### Adding Your Instrument

Once you begin to feel confident playing polyrhythms, you can practice them with your instrument. Have the metronome maintain one rhythm. Perform the other rhythm on your instrument.

- Set the metronome to a slow eighth note pulse (1 &, 1 &, 1 &).
- Now play triplets over the 1 &, 1 & ... pulse of the metronome.
- Try a scale.
- Try improvising.

Which is more difficult? Patting your head and rubbing your tummy or playing polyrhythms?
