So you want to get better at rhythms, eh? Gain a little independence between your hands? Polyrhythms are a great way to start. A polyrhythm is two different rhythmic patterns played simultaneously against one another.

With your attention on the individual beats within the two rhythms, you become entranced by the resulting pattern. Polyrhythms are known for their hypnotic character. It may be why we enjoy listening to them as much as we want to get better at playing them.

To begin, start with the most basic of polyrhythms, 2 against 3.

## 2:3

The most accurate way to practice any polyrhythm is with a [metronome](https://pitchplay.io). Look at, listen to, and then try playing the polyrhythm yourself.

AUDIO

*Exercise*

- Set your metronome to a slow BPM (40-50).
- Begin by tapping eighths for each beat of the metronome.
- Speak the triplet value over the steady eighths.
  - sometimes verbalizing the rhythm can help, try "George Washington"
- Now try adding the triplet value you are speaking to your other hand.
- Once you are getting the hang of it, switch hands.
- Increase the tempo of the metronome.

Additionally, [visualizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8tKbd91kFA) the rhythm may help.

## 3:4

Following the same steps as with 2:3, you can learn other polyrhythms like 3:4. In this case, while one hand taps three beats, the other hand will tap four.

AUDIO

*Exercise*

- Set your metronome to a slow BPM (40-50).
- Begin by tapping 4 sixteenth notes for each beat of the metronome.
- Speak the triplet value over the sixteenth notes.
- Try and add the triplet value you are speaking to your other hand.
- Once you are getting the hang of it, switch hands.
- Increase the tempo of the metronome.

## 5:4

Now, while one hand taps four beats, the other hand will tap five.

AUDIO

*Exercise*

- Set your metronome to a slow BPM (40-50).
- Begin by tapping 4 quarter notes with one hand.
- Speak the 5 value over the 4.
  - "Min-ne-ap-o-lis" and "Un-i-ver-si-ty" are 5 syllable words that work over the four quarters
- Try and add the 5 value to your other hand while maintaining the 4 quarters.
- Once you are getting the hang of it, switch hands.

### Adding Your Instrument

Once you begin to feel confident playing polyrhythms, you can begin practicing them with your instrument. Have the metronome maintain one rhythm. Perform the other rhythm on your instrument.

*Exercise Example for 2:3*

- Set the metronome to a slow eighth note pulse (1 &, 1 &, 1 &).
- Now play the triplets over the 2 with your instrument.
- Try a scale.
- Try improvising.

### It's Just the Beginning

Once you've mastered these polyrhythms, you can begin working on less common ones. With practice and time, you can ingrain the rhythms physically and mentally. Which polyrhythm will you try next?
