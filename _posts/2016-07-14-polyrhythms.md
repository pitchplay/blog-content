So you want to get better at rhythms eh? Gain a little independence between your hands at the same time? Polyrhythms are a great way to do both. A polyrhythm is two different rhythmic patterns played simultaneously against one another. With your attention on the individual beats within the two rhythms, you become entranced by the changing pattern that results. Polyrhythms are known for their hypnotic character. It may be why we enjoy listening to them as much as we want to get better at playing them.

To begin, master the most basic of polyrhythms, 2 against 3.

## 2:3

The most accurate way to practice any polyrhythm is with a [metronome](https://pitchplay.io).

*Exercise*

- set your metronome
- begin by tapping duplets on your knee with one hand
- speak the triplet value
- try and add the triplet value to your other hand while maintaining the duplets
- once mastered, switch hands

Did you notice that the second eighth note in the duplet falls in-between the last two notes of the triplet?

Sometimes verbalizing the rhythm can help you realize how the two rhythms align. For 2:3 polyrhythms, try verbalizing "George Washington."

Additionally, [visualizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8tKbd91kFA) the rhythm may also help.

### 3:4

Following the same steps as with 2:3, you can learn other polyrhythms like 3:4. In this case, while one hand taps three beats, the other hand will tap four.

*Exercise*

- set your metronome
- begin by tapping 4 sixteenth notes on your knee with one hand
- speak the triplet value
- try and add the triplet value to your other hand while maintaining the sixteenths
- once mastered, switch hands

### 4:5

In this case, while one hand taps four beats, the other hand will tap five.

*Exercise*

- set your metronome
- begin by tapping 4 quarter notes on your knee with one hand
- speak the 5 value over the 4
- try and add the 5 value to your other hand while maintaining the 4 quarters
- once mastered, switch hands

Min-ne-ap-o-lis and Un-i-ver-si-ty are both great 5 syllable words that work over the four quarters.

### Adding Your Instrument

Once you begin to feel confident playing polyrhythms, you can begin practicing them with your instrument. Set the metronome to maintain one aspect of the rhythm and you perform the other on your instrument. Pre-determine what notes you want to play. Try improvising. The opportunities are endless.

### It's Just the Beginning

Once you've mastered the above common polyrhythms, you can begin working your way through less common ones.
For many people, the rhythms do not come naturally. With practice and time, you can ingrain the rhythms physically and mentally. Practice them whenever you can.
