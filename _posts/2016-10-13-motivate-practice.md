## 1) Find a Flow

If you are feeling overwhelmed, you are likely to avoid practicing. To overcome the feeling, pick one small, simple and achievable task.

When the task is small enough that you can focus on one single thing, you can achieve it. Small achievements will motivate you and will help you create a flow. Over time, you will reach your bigger goals.

## 2) Listen to Become Inspired

Listen to a piece of music that features your instrument. Before you know it, your creative senses will begin to stir. Hearing something you love is inspiring and your fingers will begin itching to play.

## 3) Be Silly

If the thing that is keeping you from practicing, is picking up your instrument, be silly. When playing your instrument feels like a chore, you need to do something that is fun. Try exploring the sounds that your instrument is able to produce. For example, write a spooky song in the spirit of Halloween.

Additionally, always keep your instrument in sight. If it is hidden away, it may seem like too much work to dig it out. Keep it some where safe but easy to access.

## 4) Share to Inspire

Learning new things is often motivating and inspirational. Teaching can also be motivating and inspirational.

Share something you know and in turn, you'll inspire yourself to practice.

## 5) Think of Later to Avoid Neglecting Now

Remind yourself of how you will feel forgoing your practice. It may be enough to remind you of how harmless spending a few minutes on your instrument will be. Regret tends to last longer than the few moments it will take you to pickup your instrument.

Turn off the part of your brain that is allowing you to make excuses about why you should not practice.

## 6) Plan For Your Break

It may sound silly but planning for your break may give you the initiative you need to get started.

Plan to reward yourself with a cup of coffee, tea or juice after a half hour (or however long) practice session. This will give you something to look forward to. Furthermore, it will help keep you on track and motivate you to start your practice.

## 7) A Time and Space

Set a deadline for what time you would like to have your practice done by. You will feel great about all the pre and post practice time you have. Scheduling your day is a great way to achieve a consistent routine.

Additionally, you should create your own practice space. In the space you can keep all the things you may need when you are practicing. This will help focus your mind and keep you on task.

## 8) Reward Yourself

Reward yourself for your hard work. If you practice for the amount of time that you have set, reward yourself with a treat. Likewise, you can reward yourself if you accomplish a goal that you had set out to achieve.

Your reward could be as simple as a cup of coffee (see number 6) or putting aside some money towards future retail therapy.

## 9) Re-ignite The Fire

What inspired you to choose the instrument you have chosen to play? The passion that inspired you to begin playing music is still in you. Find and re-ignite your desire to learn and play. Having a performance or goal to work towards will always be one of the surest ways to fuel the fire.

## 10) Fake It Till You Make It

Even if you don't feel like practicing, act like you do.  With the catchphrase "fake it till you make it," you will find yourself in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Although pretending that you are enjoying practicing may feel forced at first, the association of practice with accomplishment or enjoyment will settle in.
