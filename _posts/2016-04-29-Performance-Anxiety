# Fear of the symptoms that make-up our anxiety and our resourcefulness in
attempting to deny or change those symptoms results in an inner battle that focuses almost
soley on our anxiety instead of on our performance.

Performance anxiety is the body's fight or flight mechanisms that kick in when you are faced with a
performance. Although the symptoms and the severity of them vary for every individual, the most common
symptoms are:
- repetitive and or negative thoughts
- a racing pulse
- changes in your breathing
- trembling hands, lips, knees or voice
- nausea or an uneasy feeling

Anyone that has ever tried to combat those symptoms knows that it is a difficult
feat. A common list of suggestions you can find online include:
- be better prepared
- limit your caffiene and sugar intake
- focus on friendly faces in the audience
- laugh
- exercise daily and get adequate sleep
- speak to a professional about beta blockers

Have you ever wondered why you were unable to eliminate your performance anxiety even after combining
many of the above suggestions? The suggestions listed above for combating anxiety do not
target the "problem." Instead, they attempt to distract, change or mask it.

Anxiety is caused by both the way we think and feel. Stress about those feelings and fear of
the anxiety is what makes "performance anxiety." By learning how to confront and accept the feelings and fears, you can
overcome your anxiety about a performance. It sounds simple, confront and accept that anxious feeling and
fear of the performance and you will not have anxiety about the performance. It couldn't really be that simple, could it?

## How Do You Do It?

First, understand that there is nothing wrong with feeling anxious but that allowing
the anxious feeling to settle in because you believe you deserve it or that there is
no successful way to combat it is not okay.
Many performers, myself included, are guilty of allowing
ourselves to suffer with all of the limitations and stress that the
negative thoughts attributed with having performance anxiety impress on us.
We may believe that the anxiety can not be helped
or that "help" is too difficult to implement.

^^ (Performance Anxiety is what happens when you focus on yourself and your anxiety,
rather than your presentation or performance. It stems from a tendency to resist and
fight your anxiety, rather than to accept and work with it. It's the result of thinking
of the performance situation as a threat, rather than a challenge.)
^^ Stage fright is like being
heckled mercilessly during your performance, and getting into an argument with the heckler,
except that it's your own mind doing the heckling. You get so involved in your internal struggle
that you don't get involved with the actual performance. Most people with performance anxiety fright
get tricked into focusing on themselves, struggling against anxiety in a vain effort to get rid of it.

## Directing Your Anxious Energy

Have you ever welcomed the rush of anxious energy you feel before stepping on a stage?
Did you know you could use your anxious energy to your advantage?

Vizualize gathering all your energy, the excitement,
fear, nervousness, all of those emotions. Imagine drawing them into a centre or focal point within your body.
Some people use, their belly button as a gathering place for the energy.

Once gathered, imagine pushing it upwards. You can release the energy through your hands, eyes, mouth or top
of your head. When you release the energy, imagine that you are placing it in the air around you
as fuel for your performance. Chances are, you will still be able to "feel" it but it is no longer going to
influence your performance. Remember, those feelings are okay to have but you are not going to focus on them.
If you feel like you still have anxious energy after having done so, do it as many times
as you need to. Just means that you'll have more fuel to draw on during your performance.
Try to keep in mind that you are not trying to dispose of the anxiety. You are simply re-directing the
feelings. A lot of our feelings in regards to performance anxiety are habitual responses to
a situation, i.e., a performance. Don't be frightened of them, don't diminish them.
Once you realize that there is nothing to fear about those feelings, they'll altogether disappear.
