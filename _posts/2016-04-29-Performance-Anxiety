# Fear of the symptoms that make-up our anxiety and our resourcefulness in
attempting to deny or change those symptoms results in a battle that focuses almost
soley on our anxiety instead of on our performances.

Does your body's fight or flight mechanisms kick in when you are faced with a performance?
Have you ever experienced:
- repetitive and or negative thoughts
- a racing pulse
- changes in your breathing
- trembling hands, lips, knees or voice
- nausea or an uneasy feeling

If you have ever looked up how to combat those symptoms, chances are you have stumbled
across a plethera of suggestions such as:
- be better prepared
- limit your caffiene and sugar intake
- focus on friendly faces in the audience
- laugh when you can
- exercise daily and get adequate sleep
- speak to a professional about beta blockers

Do the suggestions work? No, for most people, even ensuring that you incorporate every suggestion
you come across into your lifestyle will not eliminate your performance anxiety.
Anxiety is caused by both the way we think and feel. Stress about those feelings and fear of
the anxiety leads to the performance anxiety itself. By learning how to confront those fears, you can
overcome the performance anxiety.

There's nothing wrong with expecting to feel anxious. It is working towards accepting the anxiety that is
the problem.

^^ Performance Anxiety is what happens when you focus on yourself and your anxiety, rather than your presentation or performance. It stems from a tendency to resist and fight your anxiety, rather than to accept and work with it. It's the result of thinking of the performance situation as a threat, rather than a challenge. Stage fright is like being heckled mercilessly during your performance, and getting into an argument with the heckler, except that it's your own mind doing the heckling. You get so involved in your internal struggle that you don't get involved with the actual performance. Most people with performance anxiety fright get tricked into focusing on themselves, struggling against anxiety in a vain effort to get rid of it.
