# Fear of the symptoms that make-up our anxiety and our resourcefulness in
attempting to deny or change those symptoms results in an inner battle that focuses almost
soley on our anxiety instead of on our performance.

Performance anxiety is the body's fight or flight mechanisms that kick in when you faced with a
performance. Although the symptoms and the severity of them vary for every individual, the most common
symptoms are:
- repetitive and or negative thoughts
- a racing pulse
- changes in your breathing
- trembling hands, lips, knees or voice
- nausea or an uneasy feeling

Anyone that has ever tried to combat those symptoms knows that it is a difficult
feat. A common list of suggestions you can find online include:
- be better prepared
- limit your caffiene and sugar intake
- focus on friendly faces in the audience
- laugh
- exercise daily and get adequate sleep
- speak to a professional about beta blockers

The problem with most of the suggestions is that even the people that incorporate every suggestion
into their lifestyle are still unable to eliminate their performance anxiety. The suggestions do not
target the problem but instead attempt to distract, change or mask the problem.

Anxiety is caused by both the way we think and feel. Stress about those feelings and fear of
the anxiety is performance anxiety. By learning how to confront and accept the feelings and fears, you can
overcome the performance anxiety. You do not want your focus on yourself and your anxiety. You have to shift your focus to
what you are supposed to be doing. Accept the anxiety and change your thinking patterns.


There's nothing wrong with expecting to feel anxious. So many performers, myself included, are guilty of allowing
ourselves to suffer with all of the limitations and stress that the
negative thoughts attributed with having performance anxiety impress on us. Fearing you can't be helped
or that the help is too difficult to implement is a lame excuse. Stop thinking of your performances
as threats and see them as a challenge.

^^ (Performance Anxiety is what happens when you focus on yourself and your anxiety,
rather than your presentation or performance. It stems from a tendency to resist and
fight your anxiety, rather than to accept and work with it. It's the result of thinking
of the performance situation as a threat, rather than a challenge.)
^^ Stage fright is like being
heckled mercilessly during your performance, and getting into an argument with the heckler,
except that it's your own mind doing the heckling. You get so involved in your internal struggle
that you don't get involved with the actual performance. Most people with performance anxiety fright
get tricked into focusing on themselves, struggling against anxiety in a vain effort to get rid of it.

## Direct Your Anxious Energy

The ways in which we are taught to deal with performance anxiety often lead us to believe that
the feelings we associate with our anxiety and being nervous are negative ones.

Welcome the rush of energy and use it to your advantage. If you can channel it into your
performance you will be blown away by the amazing things you'll accomplish.

Learning how to direct your energy may be the most important thing that you could do to
target and correct the symptoms of your performance anxiety. Vizualize gathering all your energy, the excitement,
fear, nervousness, all of those emotions and draw them into a centre you can pin point, usually it's good to
have the centre around your belly button as it is a centrally located part on your body. Once you've gathered all of that
energy imagine releasing it upwards out through your eyes. Release the energy as if it is the life force behind your music.
The fuel you'll use in the air around you to bring atmosphere to your performance. Accept your experience,
accept the feelings and let them charge the air around you with excitement and anticipation.

It is important to recognize that a lot of our feelings in regards to performance anxiety are habitual responses to
a situation, a performance. Try something new to deal with the anxiety. Recognize that the way you currently deal
with performance anxiety might
not be working for you. Allow your feelings to be there. Don't be frightened of them, don't diminish them. 
Once you realize that there is nothing to fear about those feelings, they'll altogether disappear.
