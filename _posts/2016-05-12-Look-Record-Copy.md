## Mirror
Have you ever watched a video of yourself playing and recognized a bad habit you had not realized you
were doing?

Now you can keep on top of your technique and posture by using our on-site mirror. While practicing you
can simply click the camera icon along the top right row of your practice canvas. Enable your webcam and
keep yourself in line.

## Self-Recording
Sometimes it is difficult to be analytical of your performance while you are playing.
We have you covered!
Use the self-recorder to record and listen back to something that you are working on. With the ability to hear yourself free of the distractions of performing, analyzing and adjusting at the same time, you will be able to note and then fix the areas of your performance you want to improve.

Additionally, the self-recording ability works great for working on harmonies. Count yourself in and then record yourself playing the melody and have it loop back to you continuously. This way you don't have to continue pressing play and you can work on that harmony. Sing, play, do what you do best!

## Copying a Practice Routine
Our newest feature, practicing a routine you set up yesterday over to today. There's no longer any need to
re-create the same plan over and over again. If you are working on the same things that you did yesterday, just copy and repeat. Try using the metronome, mirror or self-recording tools in your practice routine today.
