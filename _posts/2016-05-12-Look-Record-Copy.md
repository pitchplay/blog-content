## Mirror

Have you ever watched a video of yourself playing your instrument and recognized a bad habit you had not realized you
were doing?

Use our __mirror tool__ to keep your technique and posture on point. While practicing you
can simply click the camera icon along the top right row of your practice canvas and enable your webcam.

## Self-Recording

It can be difficult to be analytical of your performance while you are playing. That's one of the reasons we added the __self-record tool__.

Use the self-record tool to record yourself and then listen back to it. You can more easily analyze your playing this way. Analyzing is not the only use for this tool. Additional uses include:

* help with memorizing,
* harmonizing,
* composing and
* layering

Because we have set the self-record tool to loop back, once you have recorded something, your hands are free to work with your instrument. No need to rewind or press play again.

## Copying a Practice Routine

Do you tend to follow the same routine when you are practicing? Our newest feature, enables you to copy over the routine you set up yesterday to today.

Don't be afraid of trying something new. Use the tools available to you in your practice canvas (metronome, mirror or self-record tool) or try editing yesterdays routine. Add something new, delete something old, re-configure the times you have set for yourself. Give it a try!
