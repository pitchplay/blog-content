is beneficial for the mental development of a child's brain. This belief is known as
the "Mozart Effect."

Did you know, far beyond the reach of the Mozart Effect,
learning and playing a musical instrument not only beneficially effects the mental
development of a child but of any adult. Physical,
emotional and cognitive changes are found in those that play instruments, at any age.

## 1) Stress Relieving

## 2) Increases Intelligence
Research and [studies](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099868) conducted on the effects of playing a musical instrument and its relationship to a child's intelligence have proven that children who learn to play an instrument are able to perform better with high-level cognitive processes. These processes include making good choices, solving problems, planning and adjusting to mental demands, regulating one's behaviour, and processing and retaining information.

Think music only benefits the young? Think again!

[Studies](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/6447588/Playing-a-musical-instrument-makes-you-brainier.html) conducted on adults 65 years and older showed that after 4-5 months of playing an instrument (for an hour or more a week) there were positive changes in the brain. Lutz JÃ¤ncke, a psychologist at the University of Zurich notes that these positive changes were related to the parts of the brain that control hearing, memory and co-ordination.

## 3) Improves Social Skills
Learning an instrument enlarges your social circle and helps you develop the ability to not only speak in front of an audience, but to also perform in front of one. Many instrumentalists love playing with other people. The interaction of playing with others in group classes and ensembles requires peer interaction and communication, __teamwork__.

## 4) Improves Memory
Music boosts memory power. Learning to play an instrument engages your brain in [the most active way possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0JKCYZ8hng). Keeping the brain alert and engaged sharpens the cognitive capacities and memory capabilities.

## 5) Builds Confidence
Playing and learning an instrument gives you a sense of achievement. That sense of self-achievement can help you accomplish more in other areas of your life. Because the sense of achievement is earned from the hard work of practicing, setting and attaining goals, the relationships between confidence, productivity and motivation are realized and can be applied to other areas of your life.

## 6) Develops and refines physical skills.
Instruments not only help develop ambidexterity, coordination and motor skills of the hands, arms and feet but they also encourage comfort in moving. Enhancing coordination and timing can help you in other activities such as dance and sports.

Losing touch with your creative side and being stuck in an everyday routine can be a very real problem. Learning to play an instrument fosters creativity. Music plays on one's mental, emotional and cognitive abilities. When one is engaged with making music, the brain is stimulated to think out of the ordinary resulting in improved creativity.

Unspoken cues and being aware of the overall sound of the group and one's role within the group are important skills learned as an instrumentalist. Like any language, music is used to communicate. Therefore, it requires the ability to listen in order to understand. Both group and private lessons teach us to become better listeners. In group lessons, we learn to be patient and wait our turn, listening and respecting our teacher and our peers. In private lessons we learn to listen, be attentive and respect our teacher.
