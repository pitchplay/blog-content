Why playing an instrument is beneficial & who it benefits.

## 1) Stress Relieving
Music naturally soothes the musician calming the mind and body. Playing an instrument can lower heart rate and blood pressure resulting in the body and mind feeling more relaxed.  

## 2) Increases Intelligence
Research and studies[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099868] conducted on the effects of playing a musical instrument and its relationship to a child's intelligence have proven that children who learn to play a musical instrument are able to perform better with high-level cognitive processes. These processes include making good choices, solving problems, planning and adjusting to mental demands, regulating their behaviour, and processing and retaining information.

Think music only benefits the young? Think again!

Studies[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/6447588/Playing-a-musical-instrument-makes-you-brainier.html] conducted on adults 65+ showed that after 4-5 months of playing an instrument, for an hour or more a week, there were positive changes in the brain. Lutz JÃ¤ncke, a psychologist at the University of Zurich notes that these positive changes were related to the parts of the brain that control hearing, memory and co-ordination.

## 3) Improves Social Skills
Learning an instrument enlarges your social circle and helps you to develop the ability to not only speak in front of an audience but to also perform in front of an audience. Many instrumentalists also love to play with other people. The interaction of playing with others in group classes and ensembles requires peer interaction and communication, encouraging teamwork.

## 4) Builds Confidence
Playing and learning an instrument gives an immense sense of achievement. The satisfaction of achieving something leads to a tremendous sense of self-achievement that can help you accomplish more in other areas of your life.

## 5) Teaches Patience and Perseverance
The daily effort of practicing and the years of work put into conquering reportoire and technique teaches both patience and perseverance in a world where instant gratification is increasingly present. Dedication and regular practice are required to play an instrument. Scheduling rehearsals, practice and goals within those areas helps develop a disciplined learner.

## 6) Fosters Creativity
Losing touch with your creative side and being stuck in an everyday routine life is a very real problem. Learning to play an instrument fosters creativity. Music plays on one's mental, emotional and cognitive abilities and when engaged with making music, the brain is stimulated to think out of the ordinary resulting in improved creativity.

## 7) Improves Memory
Music boosts memory power. Learning to play an instrument engages your brain in one of the most active ways possible to engage a brain. Keeping the brain alert and engaged sharpens the cognitive capacities and memory capabilities.

## 8) Makes for a better listener
Playing within an ensemble demands listening skills. Unspoken cues and being aware of the overall sound of the group and one's role within the group are important skills learned as an instrumentalist. Like any other language, music is one used to communicate and so it requires the ability to listen to understand. Both group and private lessons also teach us to become better listeners. In group lessons, we learn to be patient and wait our turn, listening and respecting our teacher and our peers. In private lessons we still must learn to listen, be attentive and respect our teacher.

## 9) Increases time efficiency
Practice takes time and time must be factored in to your already busy day. Learning how to organize and manage your time will result in quicker progress and motivation to continue to move forward. <link to practicing efficiently blog>

## 10) Develops and refines physical skills.
Instruments not only help develop ambidexterity, coordination and motor skills of the hands, arms and feet but they also encourage comfort in moving. Enhancing coordination and timing can help to prepare for other hobbies, like dance and sports.


Playing an instrument not only helps in relaxing and diminishing the stress in your life but it can help build confidence, self-achievement, develop a sense of independence and individuality all contributing to your self-discovery and identity as a beautiful, creative individual.What are the long term effects of playing an instrument?  For adults aged 65-80, it was determined that the more time a person had spent playing an instrument, the better they performed on tests of word recall, nonverbal memory, and cognitive flexibility.
