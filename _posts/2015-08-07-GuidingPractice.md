I no longer force my students to practice.

It's not that I don't want them to rehearse - trust me, I do. But telling people that they "have" to practice makes the whole thing become a chore. And this can easily kill someone's self-motivation to learn, play, or practice their instrument. Why would I choose to do that to someone?! My goal is to help people enjoy their instruments as much as they can. I want you to soak up every note and feel alive when you play music.

Rewards can be useful when you need motivation, but tangible rewards directly attached to practice is a precarious path to walk. Imagine letting a child play with a toy after practice - this may work in the short-term, but what happens if they start feeling like the reward is not worth their time? Perhaps you reward yourself with a glass of wine after spending 30 minutes with your piano. That is nice (good wine can be lovely), but what happens if you don't want a drink that day? Or maybe you've given up wine for a completely unrelated reason. Now, the reward is suddenly uncompelling and your motivator for spending time with your instrument is gone.

So, how do we deal with this? Goals! Goals are fantastic motivators. When you set goals then you've identified something specific to work toward. Goals also require a little understanding - you should have both short-term and long-term goals. It's not enough to say, "I'd like to be able to learn song X" because you may be relatively far away from achieving that goal. Deciding that you'd like to spend a week learning to play the first passage in a song is a great short-term goal because we've now taken our longer-term goal and also created a manageable, measurable chunk. When you set and achieve attainable goals, the brain rewards you with a little neurotransmitter called dopamine. I'm not going to get into the science of it, but dopamine is key in reinforcing behaviour. It makes us feel good, which tells our brain to remember what we did that made us feel this way. We can actually make learning addictive by setting goals and feeling that wonderful positive reinforcement!

Here's where it all comes together - specific actions, short and long-term goals, psychological rewards. What if I told you that games hit all of those items? Playing games is an incredible way to marry these things into a fun, repeatable package. In fact, it's why we designed PitchPlay the way we did! Almost anything can behave like a game. Simply counting the number of times you've played a piece without hitting a "bum" note is a form of gaming! Strive for 5 times in a row with each section of a song. Then, put them all together and aim to play the entire song 5 times in a row. You can be as simple or as complex as you'd like about what the boundaries, rules, and conditions are for your "game", but the fact is that if we have goals to achieve then our brains reward the achievement with positive reinforcement. The next thing you know, you'll have mastered your song. This type of technique can be used to break many musical routines down into more engaging elements.

Guess what? We've now successfully managed to turn practice from a chore into something fun. And who doesn't like fun?
