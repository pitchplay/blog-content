Have you ever heard people throwing the word "enharmonic" around and wondered just what the heck they were talking about? It turns out it is a complicated-sounding term for a fairly simple concept.

Enharmonic equivalents are two different notes that, when played, are actually the same pitch. As a quick example: `C#` is the same as `Db`. Enharmonic equivalents can also be applied to key signatures and intervals.

There are many reasons why we call the same pitch by two different names, but it's easy to explain with this image:

In the image above, you can see that we have written `C#` and `Db` as a `minor second` interval of `C`. If you want a refresher on intervals, check out our post ["What are Intervals?"]. We _could_ write the interval from `root` to `minor second` as `C -> C#` and it would be right as far as pitch goes -- if you sounded a `C#` on your instrument that would be the correct pitch. But, spatially speaking, it is incorrect when we're looking at a stave. Intervals should not occur on the same line, which is what happens if we need to sharpen `C` to make it `C#` and therefore the `minor second`. How do we fix this? Easy! We move up to the `D` line and flatten the `D` instead.

From this example, we can see that the minor second interval in both the "right" and "wrong" examples are the same pitch, but two differently named notes: `C#` and `Db`! These two notes are `enharmonic` or `enharmonic equivalents`.

Sometimes in music it's best to remember that certain things "just are the way they are". A great example of this is trying to answer: "Why did we define the Major Scale the way we did?" The answer is: because we did.

You can certainly go much deeper into the theory of [enharmonics], but hopefully this overview has given you a good, simple understanding of what enharmonic equivalents are.
