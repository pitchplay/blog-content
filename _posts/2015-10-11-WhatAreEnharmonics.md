Have you ever heard people throwing the word "enharmonic" around and wondered just what the heck they were talking about? It turns out it is a complicated-sounding term for a fairly simple concept.

Enharmonic equivalents are two different notes that, when played, are actually the same pitch. As a quick example: C# is the same as Db. Enharmonic equivalents can also be applied to key signatures and intervals. These labeled piano keys can serve as a reference for the basic enharmonic notes:

There are many reasons why we call the same pitch by two different names, but it's easy to explain with the following image. We are going to incorrectly then correctly place a minor second interval for C. If you want a refresher on intervals, check out our post ["What are Intervals?"]!

In the image above, you can see that we have written C# and Db as a minor second interval of C. C -> C# is correct as far as pitch goes -- if you sounded a C# on your instrument that would be right (and would be the same as sounding a Db!) But, spatially speaking, it is incorrect when we're looking at a stave. Intervals should not occur on the same line, which is what happens if we need to sharpen C to C# and therefore the minor second. How do we fix this? Easy! We move up to the D line and flatten the D instead.

From this example, we can see that the minor second interval in both the "right" and "wrong" examples are the same pitch, but two differently named notes: C# and Db! These two notes are enharmonic or enharmonic equivalents.

Less common, but still something musicians should know, are double sharps and double flats. If a single sharp raises a note by a half-tone (otherwise known as a semitone) then a double sharp does twice that - it raises a note by a whole-tone (or just a tone). The same goes for flats, but in the opposite direction: since a flat lowers a note by a semitone, a double flat lowers our note by a whole-tone. In music notation, a double sharp is written as x like: Dx. Double flats are written as bb like: Dbb.

Sometimes in music it's best to remember that certain things "just are the way they are". A great example of this is trying to answer: "Why did we define the Major Scale the way we did?" The answer is: because we did.

You can certainly go much deeper into the theory of [enharmonics], but hopefully this overview has given you a good, simple understanding of what enharmonic equivalents are.
